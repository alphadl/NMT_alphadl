we presented a systematic investigation of boron-doped 58s bioactive glass ( 58s-b ) to reinforce the porous 45s5 bioglass derived glass-ceramics .
the 45s5 / 58s-b composite powders were prepared by in situ mixing technique during synthesizing 58s-b via a sol-gel process .
the 45s5 / 58s-b composite glass ceramics with low and high porosity showed excellent low temperature ( 850 ℃ ) sintering behavior and improved compressive strength ( 40.2mpa ; 8.3mpa ) in comparison with the pure 45s5-derived glass-ceramics ( 14.9mpa ; 2.8mpa ) .
meanwhile , low-temperature ( 850 - 900 ℃ ) sintered composite porous glass-ceramics exhibited good biodegradability in tris buffer and a remarkable amount of bone-like hydroxyapatite was deposited on the surface of the porous materials .
this study is an important step to fabricate 45s5 bioglass derived glass ceramics with synergistic bioactivity , biodegradability and mechanical properties .
it is expected that such highly bioaetive and biodegradable porous glass-ceramics can be used for a variety of bone reconstructive surgeries , cell scaffolds , and regenerative medicine

bikou terrane is bounded by qinling orogenic belt to the north , songpan-ganzi oro- genic belt to the west , and yangtze block to the southeast . accompanying with indon-china oro- genic events in chinese continent , a lot of granitic dikes intruded in bikou terrane and its north margin .
there are mainly granitic dikes in the north margin , divided into several concentrated are- as from east to west , such as yuezhao-pibasi in kangxian , lianhecun-yangshan in wenxian .
in these areas , large to super large gold deposits were discovered one after another , for examples tangba , shuidonggou , yangshan , lianhecun , and jiawuchi gold deposits .
in this paper , new data are presented on geochemical compositions of the granitic dikes in pi- bashi , yangshan and jiawuchi in order to discuss petrogenesis , sourees of magma and tectonic set- ting of diagenesis of these dikes .
study shows that the sio2 and al2o3 of the granites range from 67.65 % to 74.86 % and 13.68 % to 19.61 % respectively , and the a / cnk varies from 1.11 to 5.4 .
rare earth elements ( ree ) content of the granites is low ( 24.22 * 10 6 -97.26 * 10-6 ) , with lan / ybn ratios of 3.29 = 22.40 . light rare earth elements ( lree ) are concentrated evident- ly and heavy rare earth elements ( hree ) are slightly negative eu anomalies ( δeu = 0.70-0.79 deficient .
the ree patterns are characterized by 79 ) . granites are also enriched in large ion litho- phile elements ( iales ) and relatively depleted in high field strength elements ( hfses ) .
it is showed that the granitic dikes were likely originated from subducted continental basement with greywackes as major composition .
on the basis of analytical data of geochronology of granites and gold deposits in this area , it is proposed that the granites in north margin of bikou terrane belong to post-eollisional setting with a peak activity of late triassic and closely related to delamination of thickening crust and underplating of mantle-derived material during collisional and orogenic processes .
these dikes were derived from partial melting of greywackes in middle-upper crust as a result of decompression and increasing temperature of thickening crust and upwelling of mantle- derived heat flow .
simultaneously , large-scale gold mineralization occurred in north margin of bikou terrane at early jurassic ( 190 ma-195 ma ) , 20 ma younger than the peak age of magma activity . ore-forming fluids and magmatie rocks may ascend along a common path , so the concen- trated districts of granitic dikes are favorable for gathering the ore-forming fluids , and conse- quently forming super large gold deposit
the maximum runout amount is an important factor in debris flow protection engineering design and hazard assessment .
in the wenchuan earthquake affected region , available methods are not doing well in the calculation of the potential runout amount of debris flow , because the sediment volume of debris flow basin has changed greatly , and the runout amount-frequency relationship differs greatly from the past .
regress analysis on the disaster area reveals that most of the debris flows in clustering debris flow events are of soil-mechanical type , and there exist a strong power-function correlation between sediment volume and maximum runout amount for the triggering rainstorm of 20-year return period .
volume and properties of sediment have a decisive influence on maximum debris flow magnitude . different amount of debris flows for different debris flow wate the hydrological forces from the rainfall processes .
the micro-topography change resulted in a hi and runout amount than predicted . the larger the frequency of triggering rainfall and the more rshed is decided by gher peak discharge sediment volume in a debris flow watershed , the more the rectangle watersheds and corresponding fan-shaped watersheds .
runout amount .
there is an obvious linear relationship between areas of maximum runout amounts , while the linear relationship is undetectable fo

rich in k , rb , ba , th and other large ion lithophile elements and loss of nb , y , yb in high field strength elements , petrological and geochemical studies show that , granodiorite formed the period is of dual characteristics of diorite and granodiorite granite of i type and s type .

la- icp ms dating yields a 294.6 ma ± 1.6 ma age , implying intense magmatic activity in the early permian
the maoliling pluton , lithologically consisting mainly of quartz monzodiorite , quartz monzonite and fine-grained granite , is outcropped around xianrenqiao and maoliling of linhai county , zhejiang province .
la-icp-ms zircon u-pb ages show that the quartz monzodiorites and fine-grained granites were emplaced at 105.61.0ma and 104.80.9ma , respectively .
geochemically , the quartz monzodiorites show metaluminous , calc-alkaline and potassium-rich signatures , and have relatively high concentrations of mgo , fe2o3t and cao with high mg # values ( 47.6 ~ 50.6 ) , whereas the fine-grained granites show similar signatures in metaluminous and potassium-rich , but have lower contents of mgo , fe2o3t and cao with lower mg # values ( 41.6 ~ 47.0 ) than the quartz monzodiorites .
the quartz monzodiorites are enriched in rb , th , u , pb , and depleted in nb , ta , p , ti , and have relatively high contents in zr , hf and sr , with unconspicuous negative eu anomalies ( eu / eu * = 0.77 ~ 0.95 ) .
the fine-grained granites show similar trace and rare earth elements characteristics to those of quartz monzodiorites , but are more depleted in p , ti and sr , and display some degrees of negative eu anomalies ( eu / eu * = 0.55 ~ 0.78 ) .
the quartz monzodiorites and fine-grained granites show similar sr and nd isotopic compositions , with isr values of 0.7088 and 0.7079 ~ 0.7088 , and εnd ( t ) values of -7.57 ~ -7.56 and -8.06 ~ -7.95 , respectively .
meanwhile , they also have similar zircon hf isotopic compositions , with εhf ( t ) values of -12.2 ~ -6.6 and -9.6 ~ -4.4 , respectively .
the integrated petrology , elemental and isotopic compositions suggest that the quartz monzodiorites and fine-grained granites from maoliling pluton were most likely generated under a post-collisional extensional setting , and via a process including formation of parental magma by mixing of a underplated or an intraplated mantle-derived magma and an induced crustal-melted magma in the deep crust , then suffered differentiation during magma ascent to varying degrees and at last emplaced at a hypabyssal environment
an airport is planned to build in ankang city where expansive soil distributes widely . in order to provide the necessary basic parameters for the project , a field physical test model of the stability of fill slope was built at the proposed site .
a tracking test series of deformation of expansive soil fill slope under precipitation-evaporation cycle were conducted , and the the deformation evolution law and cause mechanism were analyzed .
the results show that : ( 1 ) stormwater infiltration process of the new fill slope can be divided into three stages : free infiltration , scouring infiltration and stable infiltration .
in this test , most time of the rain infiltration process is scouring infiltration stage , resulting in limited a infiltration depth .
( 2 ) for a complete uniform fill slope , the soil swelling deformation plays the leading role in the deformation development ;
at slope top the performance is vertical expansion and contraction deformation while at slope surface the performance mainly displays horizontal cumulative deformation .
with the increase of the depth and rainfall frequency , the slope deformation rate decreases dramatically .
( 3 ) the deformation of slope is closely related to the action of rainfall and evaporation , in which rainfall is the main factor in slope abrupt change , evaporation is a necessary prerequisite for the development of deformation .
( 4 ) two approaches should be adopted in preventing deformation and failure of the slope in rainfall-evaporation : one is to effectively weaken the variations of the moisture of the soil mass in influenced range of its surface layer , the other is to prevent runoff scouring action on the slopes
current reclamation of construction waste both home and abroad is introduced .

concerning the current situations in construction waste reclamation , source minimization , industrial development and life cycle management should be urgently employed
a numerical model based on three-dimensional incompressible navier-stokes equations and turbulence k-e model for the simulation of turbidity currents is applied to study the flow and deposition of turbidity currents with con stant inflows into different slope changes .
simulated results show some important characteristics about the flow of tur bidity currents : the depth-averaged velocity of turbidity currents with constant inflows increases with bed slope ; the higher the slope , the faster the thickness of currents increases in the downslope direction ;
on the nearly horizontal bed , velocity drops obviously while that from higher slope still keeps a relative higher velocity ;
also thickness of the currents increases almost at the same rate in the down stream direction , reflecting a slope-control on the water-entrain ment of turbidity currents . as to deposition characteristics , the simulation shows that a critical slope exists for a given sediment : when the slope is lower , there are more deposition on slope than that on horizontal bed , the whole slope in creases ;
while the slope is higher , there are erosion or less deposition on the slope with more deposition on down stream horizontal bed , thus resulting in a decrease in total slope .
understanding those flow and deposition characteris tics of turbidity currents may assist us in well interpreting the in-situ profiles from outcrop or seismic survey and recon structing the environment in which hydrocarbon reservoirs from
according to the conditions of hydraulic engineering in tibet , the climatic characteristics of tibet and its influence on performances of concrete are analyzed herein .
comparing with other regions in china , tibet has higher annual average solar radiation energy , greater daily temperature difference , more dryness , less rainfall and more gales .

the lower permian carbonate deposits of the chihsia formation located in chaohu , lower yan- gtze are studied in this paper , with emphasis on the relationship between paleoproduetivity , redox condi- tions and the formation of source rock , upon the basis of element geochemistry .
the results demonstrate that ba and tn have evident relations with biological deposition and can be used as a geochemical proxy for paleoproductivity . v / ( v2c-ni ) ratio , as a geochemical proxy to reconstruct the paleoredox , indicates that the chihsia formation was formed in an oxygen-deficient environment .
the above mentioned proxies sug- gest that paleoproductivity and paleoredox have close relation with sea level fluctuation .
the effective matching of algae productivity and preservation condition made the region favorable for source rock forma- tion while the chihsia formation was deposited .
high quality source rocks mainly occur in the lower part of the middle limestone member of the formation
no &quot; stationarity &quot; exists in the environmental background for the formation of many river flood series in the world any longer , and the traditional extreme value flow analysis , i. e . &quot; extreme value theory &quot; must be amended in order to adapt to these phenomena .
the annual maximum peak flow of longchuan and heyuan stations in dongjiang river basin exhibited a decreasing trend at the significance level of 0.01 detected by mann-kendall test after hydraulic engineering regulation .
in this study , the non-stationary processing method of time-varying moments ( tvm ) was adopted to analyze and calculate the annual maximum daily flow series at longchuan and heyuan stations of the dongjiang river basin .
five types of distribution curves and eight kinds of trend models , for a total of 40 models , were selected for comparison .
the results showed that lognormal distribution ( ln2 ) with a cp model ( cp refers to both the mean value and standard deviation have a parabolic type trend and the ratio of the two is constant ) at longchuan station , gumbel distribution with a cp model at heyuan station may obtain the optimal fitting effect .
after significant changes occur to the hydrological regime , the concept of tradition flood should be amended .
based on traditional frequency analysis methods , the design value of 100-year flood was available , indicating that a return period changed from less than 100 years before hydraulic engineering construction to 400 years after 2000 at two hydrological stations , rather than 100 years , for both stations .
in the context of non-stationarity , the flood design value corresponding the present time points should be recommended

the analysis results are compared with results from experiments and other methods . the model is shown capable of simulating the whole process of accumulation of viscous debris flows
chengdu clay was stabilized by a new soil stabilizer prepared in laboratory .
its me- chanical properties , mineral composition and soil structure were revealed by unconfined compres- sive strength test , x-ray fluorescence and scanning electron microscope .
the results show that the clay minerals in chengdu clay were montmorillonite , llite and kaolinite , while non-clay minerals were quartz and feldspar .
after stabilization , free water was converted to crystal water , and co- lumnar ettringite crystals and honeycomb or pompon-like aluminum hydroxide gels were genera- ted in the stabilized soil , forming new ettringite-clay minerals structure .
the maximum unconfined compressive strength of stabilized soil could up to 2.28 mpa . it was confirmed that chengdu clay can be significantly reinforced by the new soil stabilizer
based on the locating monitoring and sample plot investigation of groundwater level , the quanti- tative characteristics of the vegetation community under different groundwater levels in the xilin river ba- sin were studied .
the results showed that with the increase of groundwater level , the water ecotype of vegetation changed from hygrophytes to mesoxerophytes and xerophytes ;
the number of species communi- ty and biomass of riparian community firstly increased and decreased later with the increase of groundwater level ;
simpson index , shannon-wiener index and margalef index increased firstly , and decreased later .
the species composition , biomass and margalef index were the top and pielon index was the smallest with groundwater level of 1.7 m .
when the groundwater level increased to 5.8 m , the species number , biomass and margalef index began to decrease while pielon index rose , and simpson index and shannon-wiener in- dex were maximum ;
the specie number , biomass and the diversity index changed slowly with groundwater level more than 5.8 m
there are many collapse depressions at the yellow river subaqueous delta , of which the inner strata show disturbed structures .
through engineering geological investigation in the disturbed strata in depressions , particle size , bulk density , water content and soil strength of the sediments were collected , as well as features of the shallow-stratum acoustics profiles .
in laboratory , flume experiments were carried out using the silty soil taken from the yellow river delta for bottom bed .
an engineering strata configura- tion similar to the disturbed stratum at the yellow river subaqueous delta was formed on the bed when it was liquefied and movable .
it is concluded that liquefaction and movement of the silty seabed were caused by strong waves during the storm , leading to differentiation of sediments granularity and then in-situ re- stratification .
structural features of the storm deposited strata in-situ , formed by wave-induced liquefac- tion and movement , were also put forward

the 137cs tracer method was used for estimate of soil erosion in the daguhe river basin . also discussed are the process and features of erosion , the relationships between soil erosion and the erosional depth and soil granularity .
the soil erosion modulus of the xiaoguhe river and the upper daguhe river is 468 t / ( km2 · a ) and 308 t / ( km2 · a ) respectively , both belonging to moderate water erosion .
in soil pro- files , ^ 137 cs is mainly concentrated below about 30 cm in depth . no peak has been found in top soils .
there is an obvious positive correlation between 137cs concentrations and soil grain sizes , especially for the soils bigger than 4 ф ( 〈 0 . 063 mm ) .
it is inferred that 137cs was mainly adsorbed on the surface of silly sand and clay minerals , rather than coarse particles

water contents and chemical compositions of normal anhydrous minerals from early-paleozoic songshugou and tongbai terrain granulites and paleo-proterozoic junan granulite xenoliths were obtained by fourier transform infrared spectrometer ( ftir ) and electron microprobe ( emp ) respectively .
plagioclases in granulites contain trace amounts of water in the form of structurally bound hydroxyl and less molecular water . water contents ( h2o wt .
) of plagioclase range from 465 * 10-6 to 733 * 10-6 at songshugou , from 210 * 10-6 to 993 * 10-6 at tongbai , and from 717 * 10-6 to 1 239 * 10-6 at junan , respectively .
combined with previous results for paleo-proterozoic granulites ( junan and nushan xenoliths and hannuoba terrain ) and mesozoic granulites ( daoxia and hannuoba xenoliths ) , it seems that water contents in the lower continental crust of eastern china were variable with time .
water contents of paleozoic and proterozoic granulites are much higher than those of the mesozoic granulites and there is no difference between paleozoic and proterozoic granulites , implying the existence of a more hydrous lower continental crust of eastern china before mesozoic

therefore , delta sand body is still the target of exploration in the future . meanwhile , the exploration of sand body formed in deep lake and during flooding should be enhanced .
the sand body distribution rule in the east gentle slope break zone is different to that in the west steep slope break zone , so we should adopt a different exploration strategy for different areas

this research is based on the systematic field geological survey , indoor petrographic and ore microscopic studies , zircon la-icp-ms u-pb dating and analysis of major and trace elements . the authors chose sousha skarn mineralization spot and zai &apos;a skarn iron polymetallic deposit to conduct researches on the relationship between the petrogenesis and the mineralization .
there are mainly fine grained porphyritic granodiorites in sousha area and fine grained granodiorites in zai &apos;a .
zircon &apos;s la-icp-ms dating indicates that the age of the fine grained porphyritic granodiorite is 77.37 ± 0.55 ma , whereas that of the fine grained granodiorite is 79.78 ± 0.99 ma , suggesting products of late cretaceous magmatism .
their a / cnk values change between 0.78 and 1.29 , and a / nk values change in the range of 0.88 ~ 1.51 . the rocks belong to weakly peraluminous .
they are enriched in big ion incompatible elements rb , th , u and k , and depleted in nb , identical overall with the same period granite in bangong co-nujiang river metallogenic belt .
these data indicate that the separation of plagioclase crystallization might have occurred in magmatic evolution processes .
the ore-forming processes of sousha and zai &apos;a rock bodies might have had something to do with the southward subduction of the bangong co-nujiang ocean basin and acted as the products of magmatic activity after closing .
with favorable iron and bismuth polymetallic ore-forming geological and geochemical conditions , this area deserves more attention in further prospecting and evaluation work

due to the high sensitivity of magnetic resonance sounding ( mrs ) instrument for groundwater exploration , the nv-level mrs signal received from the instrument is susceptible to interference of high industrial frequency harmonics , which leads to accuracy decrease in signal parameter extraction and influences the inversion result .
to solve this problem , a 90 ° phase-shift adaptive noise cancellation system with reference coil for mrs full wave signal , based on the principle of correlation cancellation , is designed in this paper . the distance of reference coil away from the detection coil is theoretically calculated , and the algorithm of variable step adaptive noise cancellation is presented .
the simulation results show that with different signal amplitudes and signal to noise ratios ( snr ) , adopting the adaptive noise cancellation system and variable step algorithm can increase snr to 5.94db or above , while the fitting error of initial amplitude and relaxation time is within 2.8 % , when industrial frequency harmonics are not in coincidence with the signal frequency .
however , when they are in coincidence , snr can reach 5db or above and the fitting error of initial amplitude and relaxation time is within 10 % . the result of the variable step adaptive noise cancellation algorithm meets the requirement of practical application .
processing of field measured signals further proved the effectiveness of this algorithm

atypical snowfall forecast is a complicated issure in beijing area . it is especially difficult to determine the role played by the east wind in light snow process .
based on the conventional observation data and various intensive sounding data , two cases including a false snowfall prediction and a first snowfall process occurring in winter 2010 are analyzed .
the analysis shows that : wet or dry conditions for the east wind , depend mainly on the humidity of the upstream eastern region .
when the upstream eastern region is dry , the east wind is dry , and thus could not provide moisture for beijing .
the cause for the false snowfall prediction is that the east wind is a dry advection which is unfavorable to humidification at night on december 12,2010 . low humidity in the boundary layer is the main reason in spite of favorable vertical upward motion .
the dry and cold airs in areas north of beijing moving southwards rapidly and invading are the other major reason for the forecast deviation .
under the favorable condition of abundant water vapor in the boundary layer and weak convergence and ascending motion , a steady rainfall process occurred .
the results show that moisture conditions in the boundary layer are very important for winter snowfall prediction .
it is difficult to cause effective precipitation even with strong ascending motion in upper air but poor water vapor condition in the boundary layer .
in fact , distinct precipitation may occur in case of warm and wet air mass and weak convergence and ascending motion in the boundary layer even without apparent convergence systems
a detailed three-dimensional p-wave velocity structure of the crust and the upper mantle beneath eastern china was determined by applying teleseismic tomography to 12078 high-quality p-wave arrival times from 9802 teleseismic events recorded by 652 broadband stations of seismic networks .
the tomographic image shows that obvious low p-wave velocity ( low-vp ) anomalies exist under datong volcano , wudalianchi volcano , guangdong province , bohai gulf and yangtze block .
significant high-vp zone of sichuan basin and low-vp zone of yangtze block are also fairly evident in images of vertical cross-sections of p-wave tomography .
the collision-driven , large-scale lateral mantle flow under eastern china may help explain the broad and dispersive mantle upwelling under eastern china . the subduction of pacific plate is only one of the mantle upwelling causations
in light of the hydrochemical monitoring data of 22 groundwater discharge points , the differences of the hydrochemic features and the impact factors of the groundwater in and around the jinfoshan natural reserve , chongqing is compared in the article .
the results show that the ph values of the springs outside the reserve are lower than those inside , but the conductivity is higher .
the median concentration of ca2 + , mg2 + , na + , k + , cl- , no-3 , so42-and hco-3 around the reserve are respectively 27.78 mg / l , 3.23 mg / l , 3.47 mg / l , 0.97 mg / l , 2.38 mg / l , 9.29 mg / l , 15.06 mg / l and 42.03 mg / l higher than those inside the natural reserve .
the mg2 + / ca2 + ( mole ratio ) in dolomite aquifer is 0.76 ~ 1.33 , obviously higher than that in limestone or clastic rock aquifer .
but in the same limestone aquifer the mg2 + / ca2 + around the reserve is higher than those inside .
the results indicate that gsica2 + is 0.097 , gsihco-3 is 0.125 , gsino-3 is 0.008 in the reserve , and gsica2 + is 0.415 , gsihco-3 is 0.334 , gsino-3 is 0.648 around the reserve .
the water quality of the reserve is mostly grade i andⅱ .
but affected by agricultural fertilization , industrial pollution and sewage discharge , the springs water outside the reserve is ⅲ andⅴ , and the no-3 concentration is higher in springs n0.1 , no.16 and no.19.
over all , the water quality inside the reserve is significantly better than the outside . it can clearly be seen that the establishment of natural reserves has positive significance for karst water protection
based on the 1999-2009 ionex total electron content ( tec ) data over 120 ° e from igs , we studied annual and seasonal variations of the tec at the daily northern anomaly crest ( inc ) and southern anomaly crest ( isc ) as well as solar and geomagnetic effects on the equatorial ionization anomaly ( eia ) .
the variation of inc and isc is correlated well with solar p index but poorly correlated with geomagnetic dst , kp and ap index .
it is found that the inc and isc are almost highest in equinoctial season on northern hemisphere and the values in winter are greater than the summer values which showed the semiannual anomaly and winter anomaly in inc .
we attributed this to the semi-annual variation of the eastward electrojet-associated electric field .
the method of support vector regression based on support vector machines ( svm ) is used to establish the prediction model of eia index .
the results of the forecasting experiments with the model showed that this model can describe the variation of eia index inc and isc and the mean relative error of inc and isc is about 10.2 % and 22.96 % respectively .
the prediction effect of inc is better than the inc . this method provides a new approach and idea for the prediction of characteristic index of eia and shows a good application perspective

seasonal snow is the significant surface cover of the northern hemisphere and it is also one of the terrestrial essential climate variables ( ecvs ) .
the satellite remote sensing is the major means to rapidly acquire extensive snow area and snow water equivalent ( snow depth ) .
as the satellite data possesses the characteristics of multi-sources and mass , for meeting the data management requirement of long time series , a snow data management system is designed based on the data characteristics and the sub-system requirement of the digital earth science platform .
this system has the functions of data management , analysis and processing for optical and micro-wave snow remote sensing data , which strengthens the scientific support for studying the global climate change .
a concrete example based on this system has been taken using the modis snow cover fraction products for the tibet plateaus . the result reveals that the snow cover fractions show a slightly increasing trend

in most cases , total solar radiation increases with latitude decreasing .
there is positive linear correlation between the annual variations of daily total solar radiation and insolation duration .
2 ) the diurnal variation of hourly total solar radiation is significant , with the max value generally appearing from 10 : 00a .
m .
to 2 : 00p .
the conventional surface and upper-air sounding meteorological data , the hourly precipitation data from aws in shaanxi province and the ncep 1 ° * 1 ° reanalysis data were used to analyze two rainstorm processes respectively in 23-24 july 2010 ( &quot; 0723 &quot; ) and 28-29 july 2011 ( &quot; 0728 &quot; ) .
the results show that : the relatively stable circulation is the favorable background to the development of two major rainstorms , the low-level jet has established at early period of the &quot; 0723 &quot; precipitation .
for the &quot; 0728 &quot; rainstorm , jet stream was from east to west at its early period ; accompanied with the formation of low-level jet , the high-level jet stream enhances and turns upright , then heavy precipitation occurred .
the southerly flow in the east of tropical depression &quot; chanthu &quot; formed a wide and strong water vapor transport channel along the periphery of the subtropical high , however , the southeast airflow in the north of tropical storm &quot; nock-ten &quot; merged with the southwest airflow from the bay of bengal and then transported to the rainstorm area during the &quot; 0728 &quot; rainstorm .
shaanxi province is located in high-energy areas of θsc during the two rainstorm processes .
there are invasions of the dry and cold air , and potential vorticity disturbance declines along the intensive areas of θsc in the two processes of rainstorm .
temporal changes in potential vorticity and precipitation almost take place simultaneously , and the appearance of large values of potential vorticity indicates the occurrence of rainstorm

finally , a model test of 2d rtm is done to show the effectiveness and advantages of this new strategy
gumbel distribution is commonly used in hydrology and other fields .
in order to estimate its parameters , the mom ( method of moment ) , ml ( maximum likelihood ) and l-m ( linear-moment ) are introduced firstly , and then the itmom ( integral transform method of moment ) based on mellin transform is proposed .
this method is consisted of first order general moment and first order logarithmic moment , and can be divided into two cases , namely continuous samples and discontinuous samples .
taking the two hydrological stations in dianchi lake catchment at kunming city as an example , the annual maximum daily precipitation is fitted and the results are compared with those of mom , ml and l-m.it shows that the precision of itmom is almost the same as other conventional methods .
therefore , the proposed method is effective and feasible

based on the modern hydrocarbon accumulation theories , through analyzing causes for hydrocarbon accumulation and distribution characteristics , this paper analyzes factors that influence differential hydrocarbon distribution in the majiazui area of gaoyou sag , subei basin .
the results indicate that fault-lithologic reservoir is the main reservoir type which contains two kinds of hydrocarbons originatied from the e1f4 source rock in shaobo sub-sag and hydrocarbon charging occurred in the middle-late stage of the eocene .
the zonal distribution of different hydrocarbons was caused by different migration pathways , not by different sources or different migration periods ;
zhen ② and hanliu faults serve as the dominant migration pathways ;
zhen ② fault shows relatively stronger ability for hydrocarbon migration , thus hydrocarbon that occurred along zhen ② fault shows lower maturity than that along hanliu fault .
under the influence of sedimentary microfacies on reservoir properties , reservoirs of middle-terminal fan far from faults show higher oil-bearing properties than those of root-fan near faults ;
the degree to which fault-lithologic traps are filled is determined by matching fault orientations , sand beds pinching-out directions , and strike of strata
the tectonic deformations in the southern guizhou were zoned obviously . to the north of guiyang-guiding-sandu , fault belts distributed in ns direction .
the studies of fluid inclusion showed that the present fault belts were active from the late indosinian to yanshanian and their tectonic deformation features were in accordance with the general law of progressive ( attenuated ) deformation caused by the nappe of xuefeng mountain from east to west .
the rock samples from the fault belts confirmed that rocks were influenced by the squeeze and twist effect from the upper to the lower disk .
the faults were compressive . the fault belts were brittle and some were ductile .
to the south of guiyang-guiding-sandu , the thrusting of xuefeng mountain from east to west led to medium-weak or weak deformations and a gentle anticlinal tectonic framework in ne direction was formed under the influence of yaziluo squeeze and strike-slip belt .
big difference of stress field existed between the northeast and the southwest of the study area during tectonic evolution .
the anshun and changshun sags in the weak deformation belt might be favorable targets for petroleum migration and accumulation

the monthly sea surface temperature ( sst ) and ocean current data during the period from 1958 to 2007 were analyzed to study the indian ocean dipole ( iod ) phenomenon and its relationship with the el ni  o southern oscillation ( enso ) and ocean current anomaly .
based on correlation analysis of the dipole mode index ( dmi ) , the intrinsic mode function ( imf ) obtained from the hilbert-huang transform of dmi , and the southern oscillation index ( soi ) , it was found that the iod and enso might be correlated .
of all the imfs , the imf-3 that has a quasi-biennial oscillation has the strongest correlation with enso.further analysis of dmi in iod years proved the seasonal phase locking of iod.the correlation of this seasonal variation with the ocean current anomaly was then investigated .
the results show that the ocean current anomaly in the tropical indian ocean plays an important role in the coupled oscillation of sst , but may not be the cause of the rapid demise of iod

after occurrence of the wenchuan earthquake , some studies suggest that it was induced by the zipingpu reservoir which is not far from the longmenshan fault . in this paper , based on the poroelastic theory , a 3d finite element model of the zipingpu area is constructed .
according to the water level of the zipingpu reservoir from the beginning of the impoundment to the occurrence of the 2008 wenchuan earthquake , we calculate the pore pressure and the change of coulomb stress with the model .
furthermore , we discuss the effects of elastic modulus and diffusivity of faults and around medium on the results .
the results show that the elastic modulus of faults and around medium has little effect on the coulomb stress in the hypocenter of the wenchuan earthquake .
with the increase of diffusivity of the fault or around medium , the coulomb stress in the hypocenter increases .
if we give the representative values of elastic modulus and diffusivity , the change of coulomb stress in the hypocenter reaches 1 kpa when the wenchuan earthquake occurred . the zipingpu reservoir enhanced the seismic activity of the longmenshan fault .
but it needs further investigation whether increasing 1 kpa of coulomb stress can trigger the occurrence of the wenchuan earthquake .
the analysis of the distribution of small earthquakes in the zipingpu area before the wenchuan earthquake reveals that most of the small earthquakes are located in the increasing region of coulomb stress .
so it indicates that the small earthquakes in the zipingpu area should have a direct relationship with the impoundment of the zipingpu reservoir
a detailed petrographic study on the dark microgranular enclaves found in the machangqing intrusive rock body shows that , the enclaves are mostly dark black or grayish black in color , round or sub-round in shape , with apparent plastic rheological characteristics . the enclaves are in micro-fine granular texture , containing acicular apatites , k-feldspar and quartz phenocrysts from the host rocks .
these characteristics suggest the magma mixing origin of the enclaves , indicating that the machangqing intrusive rock may be the production of mixing of crust-derived and mantle-derived magma .
the injection of mantle-derived magma is a key factor to the mineralization of such magma

laodaogou copper-polymetallic deposit is a fault-controlled altered brecciation belt-quartz vein type deposit that occurred in granodiorite body of early yanshanian period .
the early stage of mineralization is copper-dominated and lead-zinc-silver dominated at the later stage of mineralization in the mining district .
fluid inclusion study showed that mainly aqueous two-phase fluid inclusions developed in quartz both from the early and later stages of mineralization .
the homogenization temperature of aqueous two-phase fluid inclusions in quartz of the early mineralization stage ranges from 226.9 ℃ to 298.5 ℃ , and salinity ranges from 5.26 wt % nacl to 9.47wt % nacl ; and the homogenization temperature and salinity of fluid inclusions in quartz from the later stage of mineralization varies between 179.3 ℃ to265.4 ℃ and 2.57 wt % nacl to 6.30wt % nacl respectively .
so the mineralization solutions is generally of medium-low temperature and relatively low salinity type and mainly came from magmatic activities and meteoric waters . coprehensive analyses results in the conclusion that laodaogou copper-polymetallic deposit is of mesothermal type in origin
the xujiahe formation is a regional gas reservoir in western sichuan depression . due to the great bu-rial depth , the reservoir generally experienced complicated diagenesis , resulting in tight to supertight reservoirs .
even so , porous reservoirs with relatively good storage capacity were also developed .
from observation of more than 30 wells , over 7 000 ordinary thin sections and over 1 000 cast thin sections in the study area as well as the research of related reservoirs , it is demonstrated that volcanic debris dissolved pores are the major storage space of sandstones of of the 2nd and 4th member of xujiahe formation , and are the major controlling factor of high quality reservoirs in the area .
dissolution of feldspar deposited through weathering and transportation of parent rock is not the major reason for the forming of sandstone with medium-high porosity .
volcanic debris from syndepositional volcanic eruption contain many &quot; soluble compositions &quot; , which tend to be dissolved and devitrified to form pores during diagenesis , thus controlling the distribution of high-permeability sandstone reservoirs with well-developed secondary dissolved pores .
therefore , the compositions of debries from the syndepositional volcanism and their dissolution intensity are the major factors controlling the development and distribution of high quality reservoirs of the xujiahe formation and the formation of sandstone with medium-high porosity .
ganzi-litang inter-continental rift area where volcanisms were strong during the late triassic was the major source for volcanic debris in the study area
the cambrian is of large burial depth and few exploration wells in tarim basin , the specific lithologic assemblage consisting of intebedded evaporites , carbonate rocks and bronzing mudstones in the moddle-lower camberan is analyzed using sequence stratigraphy and sedimentology theories .
we suggest that clay contents of gr within the depositional system can not reflect the relative sea level change , and that fine sedimentary facies division is key to base-level cycle identification .
the cambrian is divided into 3 supersequences and 7 third-order sequences , among which 4 third-order sequences occur in the middle-lower cambrian and 3 in the upper cambrian .
in addition , the features of each third-order sequence are analyzed and an isochronous stratigraphic framework is built for the cambrian .
the sedimentary environments of the middle-lower cambrian in bachu uplift are evaporate platform and restricted platform , where 2 sedimentary facies , 5 subfacies and 19 microfacies are identified .
the lower cambrian is mainly of restricted platform deposits dominated by lime flat , limestone-dolomite flat , gypsum-dolomite flat and dolomite flat deposition . in bachu uplift , the gypsum-dolomite flat deposits dominate in the west and dolomite flat deposits in the east .
in contrast , the major sedimentary facies of the middle cambrian is evaporate platform dominated by intertidal flat and saline lacustrine deposits . taking the ba3-ba1 wells as the line of demarcation , the middle cambrian is mainly of supertidal flat deposits to its west , and is dominated by intertidal flat and salt lake deposits to its east

tidal and landform variations have a significant impact on detection of coastline changes in a tidal flat environment .
this paper presents a slope correction method of determining 1985 national height datum shoreline positions from two satellite images that take into account tidal variations . furthermore , volumes of tidal flats are calculated by tidal flat gradient .
combination of remote sensing images , the measured cross-section data and depth measurement data analysis showed that although the inter-tidal range of the image has a greater impact on gradient estimates , estimation of tidal gradient is feasible by choosing appropriate images . the minimum error of consistency check is up to about 0.2 % of estimate gradient , and root mean square error of absolute check is less than the measured gradient in an order of magnitude .
muddy-silt tidal flats were used to test this method in the south coastal area of the yellow river delta . multitemporal remote sensing data of landsat mss and tm / etm from 1973 to 2009 , totaling 14 years , were used to examine the changing pattern of erosion and accretion of the tidal flat from tianshuigou to xiaoqing river estuary .
since the diversion of the yellow river in 1976 , the sediment of the river is deposited directly about 3 km from tianshuigou southward in the study area .
the maximum accretion occurs near the tianshuigou where the coastline advanced seaward over 0.7 km with a mean net accretion rate of 31 m / a . during the period 1989-2002 , rapid sedimentation happened in the southern part of the study area . accumulation of sediment and resuspended sediment from the yellow river is the major driving force .
from 1973 to 2009 , the general tendency of coastline was erosive with a mean net rate of 51 m / a .
the enhanced ocean dynamics caused by the diversion of the yellow river is the main reason .
it is indicated that the volume of tidal flats is reasonable and reliable for detecting shoreline change

then the 1971-2000 climatology normals and precipitation anomalies during 1900-2009 have been transformed into the grid boxes at resolutions of 5o * 5o and 2o * 2o , respectively , and two gridded form datasets are constructed by combining the normals and anomalies .
after that , the missing values for the 5o * 5o grid dataset are interpolated by empirical orthogonal function ( eof ) techniques .
with the datasets at different resolutions , the precipitation change series during 1900-2009 over chinese mainland were built , and the annual and seasonal precipitation changing trends for recent 110 years were analyzed .
the result indicated that the annual precipitation showed a slightly dryer trend during the 110 years , but with no statistical confidence .
to be pointed out , the interpolation of the missing values makes the precipitation amounts in the early 1900s decrease , so the trend for the 110 years increased

terrigenous components in sediment core b84a from the alpha ridge , western arctic ocean , have been investigated to reconstruct the mid to late quaternary variations in sedimentation , source regions , and related climate changes .
the core stratigraphy , evaluated by a combination of variations in mn content , color cycles , foraminiferal abundance , and lithological correlation , extends back to estimated marine isotope stage ( mis ) 12 . twelve ice rafted detritus ( ird , &gt; 250 μm ) events were identified and interpreted to mostly occur during the deglacial periods .
the canadian arctic covered by ice sheets during glacial periods is suggested to be the major source region .
the ird events likely indicate the collapses of ice sheets , possibly in relation to abrupt climate changes .
grain size analysis of b84a indicates sedimentologically sensitive components in core b84a in the silt subfractions 4 ~ 9 μm and 19 ~ 53 μm , which are inferred to be mainly transported by currents and sea ice , respectively . downcore variability of these two fractions may indicate changes in ice drift and current strength .
in accordance with previous studies in the central arctic ocean , average sedimentation rate in core b84a is about 0.4 cm / ka .
in comparison with relatively high sedimentation rates at the margins , sedimentation in the central arctic ocean is limited by sea ice cover and related low bioproductivity , as well as long distance from the source regions of terrigenous sediment

the age data of the yellow river terraces in lanzhou and along the lower reaches of weihe river are relatively reliable , but those in the jin-shaan gorge remain controversal .
further study is required as to the ages at the upstream terraces of the wei river , fen river , jing river and luo river
rockfall becomes one type of serious secondary disasters after &quot; 5.12 &quot; wenchuan earthquake . risk control technology is an important part for risk management , especially for post-reconstruction . rockfall study is therefore essential for its hazard mitigation .

x platform was built , through which some critical information for rockfall risk assessment , such as trajectory path , frequency , speed , energy , and jump height , can be obtained and simulated for complex mountainous areas .
for ra extension , the trajectory path vector is an elementary step for its following statistic analysis , such as frequency and energy jump height , or even for subsequent risk control analysis . it was shown that many trajectory vectors passed through chediguan highway bridge in the simulation . ra was applied to the extremely destroyed area along the reconstruction lifeline of the dujiangyan-wenchusan highway in &quot; 5.12 &quot; wenchuan earthquake .
a spot5 satellite image of 2.5 m resolution pixel acquired on may 22,2008 was used for deriving the source information of rockfall distribution . meanwhile , dems of high accuracy derived from 1 : 50,000 dlg topographic databases were used to construct the geomorphic surface of slope for simulation .
based on the simulation and field identification , rockfall risk assessment was realized . results show that areas of the highest risk were primarily concentrated in two places : one was along the segment of shapingguan-chediguan-zhaojiaotuo , and the other was yangdian-daping-feishaguan .
the most serious risk took place from lianshan village to caopo village .
the two points of the highest risk were chediguan and tiaoguan , which was verified by the serious rockfall hazard occurring on july 29,2009 .
the simulation and evaluation methods for risk management of rockfall disasters and control provide a rapid and accurate technique for rockfall risk assessment over large areas

research on oolitic beach reservoir of feixianguan formation in northern sichuan , with a combination of macro and micro methods , shows that the main reservoir rocks are oolitic dolomite and oolitic limestone , reservoir space is dominated by secondary pores and the reservoir property is relatively poor appearing as fracture-pore type and pore-fracture type with low porosity and low permeability .
reservoir of feixianguan formation in the study area was formed by eustatic sea level fall .
development and evolution of the reservoir were controlled by deposition and diagenesis .
the generation of ancient highland of permian changxing reef and longmenshan island chain provided feixianguan formation with high energy sedimentary condition . relative sea level fall promoted the formation of high-energy beach , and the high energy oolitic beach on platform margin is the advantageous part for reservoir development .
on the other hand , secondary pores , which markedly promoted the reservoir properties , were produced by mixing zone dolomitization and burial dissolution

by means of experimental physical simulation , the influence of stress variation on the permeability of fractured and non-fractured ultra-low permeability sandstone cores were researched , the permeability variation of the two types of cores were compared with each other , and the stress sensitivity characteristics of the fractured and non-fractured reservoirs were summarized .
the results show that for both fractured and non-fractured reservoirs , the lower permeability is , the stronger sensitivity of permeability stress is .
for non-fractured reservoirs , when the reservoir permeability is lower than 2 * 10-3μm2 , the sensitivity of permeability stress is strong and the strength increases rapidly as the permeability decreases , and when the reservoir permeability is higher than 5 * 10-3μm2 , the sensitivity of permeability stress is weak ;
the fractured reservoirs stress sensitivity is much stronger than that for non-fractured ones ;
and the permeability loss of fractured reservoirs caused by the effective stress increase is 2-3 times of that for non-fractured reservoirs ; and the permeability is unable to recover completely after the effective stress decreases , and the permeability loss of fractured reservoirs is 5 times of that for non-fractured reservoirs .
the research findings are useful for engineers to determine the development strategy for ultra-low permeability sandstone reservoirs

the land surface evapotranspiration ( et ) and soil moisture used in this paper were retrieved from land surface model ( lsm ) of noah.the variation of land surface et and soil moisture was analyzed by statistics in six large regions and by four ecosystem types in china .
then the relationship between et and soil moisture was discussed .
the long term trend of land surface et was increasing in china . the maximum et occurred in july , while the minimum one was usually at the beginning / end of a year .
the trend of et in south-central china , southwest china , east china , northeast china and northwestern china was also increasing , agreed with the whole china .
the long term variation trend of et was decreasing in north china , where the maximum et was 43.091 billion cubic meters ( bcm ) in 1990 .
the relative ratio of evapotranspiration of forest was the highest among all the ecosystem types in northeast , east , southwest and south-central china , while the highest one was grassland in north and northwest china .
to compare the amount of water used by evapotranspiration , the biggest forest et was in southwest and south central china , the smallest was in northwest china ;
the biggest grassland et was in southwest china , the smallest was in northeast china ;
the biggest farmland et was in east china , the smallest was in northwest china ;
the biggest et for desert and wet land was in northwest and northeast china respectively .
the soil moisture was decreasing in most china regions except for that in northwest china ever since 1980s , agreed with the whole china .
the main impact factors of et were vegetation fraction and soil moisture . there existed a good relationship between soil water content and evapotranspiration in rare vegetation covered regions
a procedure designed for sorting mesoscale vortices is used to sort mesoscale vortices over the lower reaches of the yangtze river during the periods may – july 2006 – 2009 by using the japan reanalysis data with high spatial resolution .
the results show that mesoscale vortices ( disturbances ) are often generated in the lower troposphere and planetary boundary layer ( pbl ) .
thus , the mesoscale vortices in this area during the meiyu period could be divided into three types : pbl mesoscale vortices , lower troposphere mesoscale vortices , and lower troposphere-pbl mesoscale vortices .
some of the pbl mesoscale vortices , called pbl mesoscale disturbance vortices ( pmdvs ) , are closely related to rainstorms . within this group , two distinct patterns of precipitation organization have been identified .
one is classified as the mcs-pmdv , which means a mesoscale convection system ( mcs ) formed before the pmdv . the other is the pmdv-mcs , which is a rainstorm caused by a pmdv . the features of pmdv-mcss could be identified as follows : ashear line and a low-level jet at 850 hpa , a closed vortex at 925 hpa , and a rainstorm center lying southeast and northeast of the vortex
with the driving of lateral boundary condition provided by era-interim reanalysis data , the simulation capability of western north pacific ( wnp ) tropical cyclones ( tcs ) during 1996-2005 was examined in the precis regional climate modeling system developed by met office hadley center .
compared with the observation data , the result indicated that the precis is capable in effectively simulating the tc-associated thermodynamic and dynamic large-scale environmental fields , as well as the distribution features of wnp tcs &apos; genesis and tracks .
the simulation of annual genesis number has significant correlation with the observation .
the simulated high value area of genesis distribution consistently corresponds to the observation , and the distribution of simulated track frequency has overall consensus to the observation , while the simulated tc genesis in south china sea is more than the observation , and the simulated track density is over-concentrated in the northeast of south china sea .
the north moving tracks of tcs and the tc intensity are underestimated in simulation compared with the observation
the association of extreme winter precipitation events in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river including synoptic-scale transient eddies is examined by using the era40 and national centers for environmental prediction / national center for atmospheric research ( ncep / ncar ) daily reanalysis data and daily rainfall data reported by 85 stations .
a close relationship is detected between extreme precipitation events and transient eddies .
in winter , two branches of synoptic-scale transient eddies are accompanied by subtropical and polar-front jets , respectively .
it is demonstrated that the south branch of the transient eddies differs during highly and less frequent years of extreme precipitation events .
overall , transient eddies become active and strong , and they spread continuously with long durationsover eurasia during highly frequent extreme precipitation years ;
the reverse occurs for less frequent years . to some extent , the intensity and energy of the transient eddies both experience similar variations from the daily frequency of extreme precipitation .
moreover , the northern branch of the transient eddies and their water vapor transport are favorable for the occurrence of extreme precipitation events .
therefore , extreme winter precipitation events have a close relationship with the synoptic-scale transient eddy , implying the activity and propagation of transient eddies may be important factors in extreme precipitation events . this study is expected to provide a new perspective for the causes of extreme precipitation
orographic clouds and precipitation have a critical role in regional water cycles , fresh water resources , ecosystems , the environment , and climate change .
the relationship between terrain dynamic forcing , mountain waves , orographic clouds and precipitation , and the formation mechanism were investigated in a conditionally unstable moist atmosphere on may 1 , 2009 , by using the weather research and forecasting ( wrf ) model and the wet froude number ( f w ) .
the results show that at a topographic height of 2 km and half-width of 10 km , when unstable airflow graduallyincreases from 2.5 to 25 m / s , the wet froude number increases from 0.19 to 1.81 .
the terrain block has a major role when f w ≤ 1 ; orographic clouds induced by terrain dynamic lifting form on the windward side , and mountain waves form mainly over the windward side and propagate toward the upstream region , which forms stratiform clouds at first and then evolves as quasi-stable shallow convective wave clouds .
the maximum precipitation occurs at the terrain crest near the windward side . when f w is too small , no precipitation is produced .
when f w &gt; 1 , the orographic clouds induced by terrain dynamic lifting form primarily at the terrain crest , and mountain waves form mainly over the leeward side and propagate toward the region downstream of the crest , producing quasi-stable shallow convective wave clouds in the downstream region .
in addition , in a weak and conditionally unstable moist atmosphere , orographic precipitation is produced mainly by warm microphysical processes induced by terrain lifting , and mountain wave clouds cannot produce precipitation
the circulation evolution and possible causes of a severe cold event over the eurasian continent during the winter of 2011 / 2012 were investigated with the ncep-ncar reanalysis data .
strong cold anomalies covering most of europe , mongolia , and northeastern china began in late january 2012 and lasted for about 3 weeks .
analysis results indicate that this cold event coincided with the phase of the arctic oscillation ( ao ) changing from positive to negative , which implied a possible impact of the ao . before this ao phase change , a minor warming occurred in the stratosphere caused by an anomalous upward propagation of planetary waves . the polar night jet then decelerated and the ao changed its sign in the stratosphere .
within 2 – 3 weeks , the stratospheric ao signal gradually propagated downward and accordingly the tropospheric ao evolved into the negative phase .
thus , a strong ural blocking high developed , and cold air invaded europe and east asia from the polar region , which induced the decreasing temperature there .
our resultssuggest that improvements can be made in predicting severe winter cold events over eurasia by taking into account the stratospheric circulation anomaly
mass conservation is an important factor in the construction of the general circulation model on the quasi-uniform overset spherical yin-yang grid , and is also a key issue when applying the yin-yang grid to numerical models .
with the help of a flux-form advection equation , we carried out a series of idealized numerical tests on a sphere to assess three conservative constraints in addition to the non-conservative boundary interpolation scheme .
the test cases included a standard solid-body advection , a benchmark deformational flow , and a sine-wave advection . the results showed that the conservative constraint of mass property is important for global numerical integration and has an effect on the computational accuracy .
the global conservative constraint that ensures local mass conservation gave accurate results . the boundary flux identification based on cell-wise mass constant distribution on the yin-yang grid achieved local and global mass conservation without either decreasing the computational accuracy or increasing computing costs .
this algorithm is computationally efficient and can be an effective numerical scheme for mass conservative constraints on the overset yin-yang grid . however , while the boundary flux identification based on cell-wise linear distribution can improve the computational accuracy , it requires much more calculation time , which will limit its application in a dynamical model
the spatial structure of the east asia jet ( eaj ) and its relation to the winter temperature in china is analyzed by using ncep / ncar monthly reanalysis data from 1950 to 2012 and daily air temperature data from 542 station in china .
the results show that the subtropical jet is divided into tubular and irregular structures .
the jet &apos;s volume becomes largest in winter , and its vertical thickness ranges from 500 hpa to 100 hpa .
in summer , the jet was just visible at 200 hpa , and its volume was smallest .
the jet tube runs from southwest to northeast in autumn , winter , and spring but from west to east in summer .
the meridional movement of the mean axes , which represents the greatest wind speed from 500 hpa to 100 hpa , is not synchronous . the wind axes at low levels are always north of the high ones in spring and autumn .
the vertical motions below each part of the eaj differ and vary seasonally .
in addition , the strength of the winter eaj , especially the middle part , is correlated with the winter temperature in china . when the middle part of the eaj is strong , the winter temperature in most parts of china might be low
the fy-2c geostationary satellite performed its first rapid regional scan test in 2011 , yielding high temporal resolution data . the mean observation frequency is about 10 min . observational test data were used to analyze a strong convective cloud development process that appeared on june 28 – 29 , 2011 , in guangdong province .
the results show that the parameter difference between high-frequency observations can be used to monitor the initial development of convective clouds .
at the initial phase of convective cloud formation , the cloud top first appeared strong cooling at the infrared window channel .
then , the brightness temperature difference between the infrared window and water vapor channels decreased , demonstrating that the height of the cloud top developed considerably . accompanied by the development of convective clouds , the minimum brightness temperature continued to decrease , and the number of cold cloud pixels increased gradually , indicating that the cloud continued to develop .
hourly precipitation data at the surface are classified into three levels : smaller than 5 mm , between 5 mm and 10 mm , and larger than 10 mm . according to the different precipitation levels , the statistical distribution of the brightness temperature in the infrared window channel was analyzed .
the results show that the cold cloud top is the main property producing strong precipitation during a strong convective cloud process .
the colder the cloud top is , the stronger the precipitation is that appears on the surface . a hovm ller diagram is used to show the evolving properties of the cloud cold core in high-frequency observation mode . combined with hourly precipitation data , it can show good agreement between the location of the cold cloud core and the center of maximum precipitation .
proper parameter estimation is critical for enhancing the simulation capability of land surface models , yet the high dimensionality of model parameters significantly increases the difficulty of parameter estimation .
sensitivity analysis of model parameters aims at identifying the most sensitive parameters for further analysis in order to estimate the parameters with finite computer resources .
in this study , we conducted sensitivity analysis of forty adjustable parameters selected from the common land model ( colm ) using soil temperature and soil moisture data .
the morris method was used to qualitatively screen out the sensitive parameters from the insensitive ones .
we also adopted the sobol ′ sensitivity method to quantitatively estimate the sensitivity of the screened parameters . the main effect , interaction effect , and total effect of the parameters were computed .
the results showed that the morris method could provide reliable parameter sensitivity analysis using a relatively small sample size , and the sobol ′ results provided a quantitative measure how each parameter contributes to the total variance of the model response , which was consistent with the results obtained by the morris method
using data from wind profile radar and automatic surface weather observation stations , and ncep 1 * 1 analysis data , a comparative analysis of two cases of low-level easterly winds ( llews ) associated with two local rainstorms in beijing was performed .
the investigation concentrated on the formation mechanism , the features of the vertical structure and thermodynamics , and the role in local rainstorms .
2 ) the sllew was caused by a sub-synoptic-scale warm vortex generated in the boundary layer , whereas the dllew was caused by a synoptic-scale inverted surface warm trough .
3 ) both the sllew and dllew were accompanied by high equivalent potential temperature , and their sources were warm moist air masses located east or southeast of beijing .
there was a cold , dry air intrusion over the llews that could result in convective instability .
the sllew supported a significant local concentration of air with high equivalent potential temperature , and the dllew contributed to the transportation of moisture and energy and the formation of stronger low-level wind shear , which was favorable to the development of severe convective storms .
4 ) the sllew was consistent with the low-level convergence in time and space , and interacted strongly with the upper divergence , thus acting as a triggering factor ;
however , the dllew could not act as a triggering factor owing to its inconsistency
based on normal observation data , ncep reanalysis data , and the intensive observation data of automatic weather station , a comparative analysis on two severe torrential rain processes during meiyu period in jiangsu province on june 17-18 and july 11-13,2011 is performed .
the results show that &quot; 617 &quot; case is caused by yangtze-huaihe river shear line , beside which , strong southwest low level jet as well as low level strong cold air activities supply abundant water vapor and energy , which ensure the occurrence and development of the heavy rainstorm ;
while &quot; 711 &quot; case is resulted from tropical depression trough , with middle-low level weak cold air overlying warm-wet air transported by southeast low leve jet , the unstable condition for heavy rain occuring and maintaining is produced .
the coupling of helicity with a negative ( positive ) value at upper ( lower ) levels and ageostrophic vertical upward column provide favorable dynamic lifting mechanism .
the two rainstorms occur in the south side area of energy front and negative area near zero isoline of the vertical component of moist potential vorticity .
the potential unstability changes from strong to weak and unstable energy begins to release , which all indicate the beginning of heavy rain
based on eof analysis on monthly mean sst data for 60 a from hadley climate center , the unipole pattern of indian ocean ssta was reconstructed , which drives iap9l agcm to investigate the propagation and distribution of the atmospheric height field during three periods including the initial adapting stage , the exact anomalous month and the climatic mean summer .
the results show : during the initial adaption , the vertical propagation of height response approximately reguires 4 d and is restricted to non-divergence of the whole layer .
the extending paths of height response present obvious horizohtal asymmetry and show distinct difference between the cold and the warm phase .
during the exact anomalous month , the global zonal rossby waves are inspired by cold phase while two wavelets are aroused by warm phase over the pacific ocean in two hemispheres ;
both of the two phases show remarkable barotropy .
for climatic summer in north hemisphere , three anomalous height zones are presented over pacific ocean for cold phase , while two wavelets are produced over both pacific ocean and atlantic ocean for warm case .
in southern hemisphere , double peak &apos;s stationary polar waves are arosed for cold phase , while global circled anomalous zones are presented for warm case

two tropical cyclones over the western north pacific that experienced an extratropical transition ( et ) , yagi and francisco , are examined in this study . the former underwent a 24-h reintensification process after the et , whereas the latter continued to weaken until dissipation .
on the basis of tropical cyclone data from the japan meteorological agency and final operational global analysis data from the national centers for environmental prediction , a comparison of the upper- and lower-level environmental fields during the et revealed clear differences .
a strong upper-level trough existed during the et for yagi ;
the baroclinic energy in the frontal zone may have been converted into kinetic energy through this process and contributed to the reintensification of yagi .
( 2 ) the downward extension of the moist potential vorticity related to the upper-level trough could have increased the positive vorticity in the lower level and induced cyclonic circulation , which strengthened yagi after the et . ( 3 ) the merging of yagi with a preexisting extratropical cyclone brought cold air from high latitudes , which can enhance the horizontal temperature gradient and cause intense development of the lower-level frontal zone .
thus , yagi evolved into a frontal cyclone and reintensified after the et . in contrast , these patterns mentioned above did not exist for francisco
based on precipitation data from weather stations , ncep reanalysis data and refined simulated product data from wrf model , the rainstorm occurred in changjiang-huaihe area caused by the combination of strong tropical storm &quot; milai &quot; and westerly trough from 20 : 00 , june 24 to 20 : 00 , june 25,2011 is diagnosed and analysed .
the results show that the strong tropical storm is mainly a barotropic system while the westerly trough is a baroclinic system , which constructs background bene ficial to easy development of rainstorm and meso-scale system .
with a short path from the east sea and a fast transportation speed , the moisture brought by strong tropical storm forms a thick moisture layer over the heavy rainfall area , where two centers of vertical velocity overlap vertically , maintain the strong moisture lifting upwards and support the rainstorm strengthen .
the analysis on dynamic barotropic and baroclinic characteristics of rainstorm environment shows that the baroclinic component is dominant in this rainstorm event .
at the beginning of the rainstorm event , the conversion from barotropic to baroclinic energy enhances rapidly and gets to the peak , but in the following rainstorm period , the conversion strength gradually reduces ;
at the end of rainstorm , the items of calculation approaches zero or even occur weak inverse conversion

by using adiabatic air parcel method of multi-component aerosols , this paper analyzes hygroscopic growth characteristics of aerosols in huangshan area in 2008 .
some calculations show that the hygroscopic growth factor f defined as d p , wet / d p , dry , where d p , wet is the particle mobility diameter under a humidified condition , is closely bound up with particle radius , relative humidity ( rh ) , particle chemical components , vertical velocity and lifting height . the hygroscopic growth of small particles is more significant than that of the large ones .
relative humidity is positively related with the hygroscopic growth factor f . the more relative humidity approaches the critical relative humidity of particles , the more the hygroscopic growth factor f changes with relative humidity .
through increasing the solute soluble inorganic aerosol influences critical saturated ratio so as to make the hygroscopic growth factor f increase .
if the role of unsolvable nucleation doesn &apos;t be taken into account , the hygroscopic growth of particles will be overestimated .
with the velocity rising , the hygroscopic growth factor reduces , and the reduction degree depends on initial relative humidity .
the lifting height can influence the hygroscopic growth factor through the change of relative humidity
the predictive capacity of a mesoscale model for short-range wind speed forecasting at a wind power farm is investigated . the results of the weather research and forecasting model ( wrf ) are compared and analyzed in this paper and also compared with observation data at a wind power farm in ulan qab .
the research shows that although the model parameterization schemes &apos; forecasting ability varies with time , the schemes show no essential difference .
the forecast level is relatively low when the weather is developing acutely .
the synoptic background is the main contributor to the model &apos;s predictive capacity .
at this wind farm , the daily mean forecast relative error of the wrf forecast with respect to the observation is only 11.78 % in 2009 , and the number of days for which the error is greater than 20 % does not exceed 15 % .
the forecast error predominantly appears when the wind speed weakens rapidly or a mongolian cyclone or northeast cyclone undergoes dramatic evolution
the measurements and electrode investigation characteristics of china-made casedhole resistivity logging tool tcfr are introduced . the tool has many features such as multi-dsp weak signal detection system , electrode with self-adaptive low resistant fluoride seal cylinder detector , dds high-power signal source , and etc .
its measurement range is 1 ~ 100 ω · m with ± 7 % errors . the point measurement time is 3 min and its electrode detector can be opened and closed in less than 45 s in total . its hydraulic electrode has great pushing force ( greater than 150 n ) . no well-washing or wax-scraper job is needed before logging job .
after 11 wells tests in changqing , tuha and huabei oilfield , it can be concluded that the result of resistivity measurement is stable and reliable
in cased holes , formation waves and casing waves often overlap , which makes it difficult to discriminate between them in time domain and hard to use wave amplitude / vdl to make a correct cement quality evaluation in fast formations .
taken cementing evaluation data of the carbonate intervals in 2 wells as an example , this article theoretically analyzes the frequency characteristics of casing waves and formation waves . actual field data processing shows that the frequency of casing waves is higher than that of formation waves .
so , with the frequency spectrum analyses , it is possible to separate casing waves from formation waves in frequency domain in the fast formation and sand shale formation .
because the frequency domain in the above two waves is different , we may use amplitude in the corresponding domain to calculate the bonding index of interface ⅰ and ⅱ

the synoptic circulation and surface characteristics of 46 convective events occurring over the huaihe river and yellow river basins from june to september during 2007 – 2010 are investigated .
the related environmental conditions are classified as dry ( 10 cases ) and moist ( 36 cases ) environments according to whether precipitable water is less than , greater than or equal to 50 mm .
the synoptic patterns in dry ( moist ) environments could be classified into post-trough and rim of subtropical high ( pre-trough , post-trough , and rim of subtropical high ) patterns .
in addition , cases in moist environments are frequently accompanied by warm and moist flow .
the pre-trough pattern in moist environments is characterized by various surface systems including a stationary front , inverted trough , cold front , and warm front . the pre-trough pattern occurs frequently in moist environments but does not occur in dry environmentsamong the cases studied here .
the convective cases are initialized at the corner of the &quot; s &quot; pattern from the surface to 500 hpa for the rim of subtropical high pattern in both dry and moist environments , but some cases in moist environments occur near the shear lines at low levels .
the post-trough pattern occurs frequently in dry environments but rarely in moist environments .
the aforementioned analyses show that significant differences exist between dry and moist environmental conditions where severe convective systems occur
a method of extended range forecasting , the low-frequency synoptic map ( lfsm ) , is introduced in this paper .
unlike statistical forecasting , numerical prediction , and synoptic forecasting , the lfsm is a new approach that can be used for extended range weather process forecasts .
the key technical points of the lfsm are the low-frequency system ( low-frequency cyclone and low-frequency anticyclone ) and the corresponding low-frequency airflow .
its synoptic significance is that the lfsm can reflect the formation , dissipation , maintenance , and motion of synoptic systems that cause weather processes , as well as the evolution of atmospheric circulation .
its advantage lies in its characteristics , including temporal periodicity and persistence , spatial continuity and similarity , and the quasi-steady properties in an area , so the lfsm can easily predict weather processes and has a longer forecast validity period .
operational practice using the lfsm in the shanghai climate center from 2008 to 2012 indicates that it can predict strong precipitation processes 15 – 45 days in advance
using the next generation of the mesoscale numerical prediction model , wrf3.2 , and the ncep / ncar four-times-daily fnl reanalysis data ( 1 * 1 ) , experiments are conducted with or without the tibetan plateau and with the plateau &apos;s height reduced to a critical height in order to study the influence of the plateau on a persistent heavy rain process that happened in may 2010 in south china .
the results show that the plateau significantly affected the precipitation ; with the uplift provided by the plateau , precipitation in the eastern area of the plateau increased and the rain belt moved from north to south .
the mechanical blocking effect of the plateau produces a strong upward motion in the side of the windward slope &apos;s near-surface layer , whereas the leeward slope shows a descending motion ; these motions correspond with the peak and valley areas of precipitation , respectively .
the effect of the plateau &apos;s climb flow and flow around on the westerly flow is obvious ; the uplift of the plateau weakens the climbing effect , and makes the airflow mainly with the effect of flow around .
the heating effect of the plateau weakens the airflow &apos;s southern breach whilestrengthening the northern breach when it flows over the plateau ;
it also strengthens the low-level positive vorticity and high-level negative vorticity over the plateau and its eastern region , bringing strong upward motion over the plateau .
the plateau &apos;s thermal effect on the west pacific subtropical high is to make its position southerly , westerly , and stable .
further , the plateau plays an important role in forming a stable plateau monsoon circulation cell ;
the height of the plateau facilitates the formation of stationary waves , the centers of which correspond to strong upward motion where considerable precipitation forms . because of the stable and long-lasting steady waves , the precipitation continues to be concentrated in the same place , resulting in persistent heavy rain
on the basis of the dynamic framework of the weather research and forecasting model ( wrf ) and the morrison two-moment explicit cloud scheme , an agi seeding scheme is developed and used to simulate stratiform precipitation during march 20 – 21 , 2008 .
the simulated rainfall is similar to the observations , in which several seeding tests for different seeding amounts , seeding levels , and seeding times are examined on the basis of cloud microphysical analysis .
the results show that seeding with an amount of 20 g slightly suppresses the surface rainfall in 30 min , rapidly enhances the surface rainfall after 30 min ;
the maximum suppressed and enhanced rainfall are 2010 t and 3.4 * 10 5 t , respectively .
the microphysical mechanism of decreasing rainfall is the depletion of supercooled water and an increase in snow and ice after agi is injected into the cloud , which lead to the decrease conversion rate of rain collide with cloud water as same as cloud water auto converse into rain water but increase conversion rate ofsnow collide with rain , while enhanced snow cannot fall to the warm region to melt at this time .
the microphysical mechanism that increased rainfall 30 min after the seeding operation is that enhanced snow gradually fell to the warm region and melted into rain .
different seeding amounts strongly influence the surface precipitation . overseeding will reduce the average mass of snow crystals , causing the falling speed to sharply decline ; thus , the amount of snow melting into rain is reduced , decreasing rainfall .
sensitive experiments with different seeding heights and seeding times show that when seeding is conducted in areas with a high supercooled water content and low ice particle content , the surface rainfall will be increased
we study the changes and relation of acoustic velocity and porosity under normal temperature and pressure and high temperature and pressure with rock core test data from suliger gas field . rock porosity decreases logarithmically with pressure increasing and decreases slightly with temperature increasing .
rock acoustic velocity increases logarithmically with pressure increasing and decreases linearly with temperature increasing .
with depth increasing , the effect of estimating pressure on acoustic velocity is about 10 ~ 30 times than that of temperature effect on acoustic velocity .
further study shows that porosity pressure affection factor decreases with porosity increasing and pressure affection factor of acoustic velocity increases with porosity increasing to different rock samples , therefore , it makes the relation of reservoir porosity and acoustic velocity become poor under normal temperature and pressure

by using daily radiosonde data and surface observation data during 1981-2010 in nanjing , xuzhou and sheyang , the forecast index of the different precipitation phases in winter is further studied by the method of thickness analysis , based on analysis of climatic characteristics of rain , snow and sleet .

( a ) the thickness threshold value at 1000-850 hpa ≤ 1 292 gpm , combined with t850 ≤ -3 ℃ and t ≤ 2 ℃ can be used to decide that snow is the most possible precipitation phase .
on the contrary , it belongs to rain .

the results show that the precipitation amount in autumn in sichuan makes up about a quarter of annual precipitation , and the precipitation amount of continuous rainfall in autumn accounts for about one fifth , which is 80 percent of the precipitation of autumn rainfall in sichuan .
the frequency , precipitation amount and the durative days all have a decreasing trend in the mass . this decreasing phenomenon is a kind of mutation and appears in later period of 1980s . the continuous rainfall in autumn increases in western sichuan while decreases in the east as a whole .
according to analysis results by eof , the overriding spatial pattern belongs to the antiphase distribution between the east and the west of sichuan
the difference of soil moisture data between automatic and manual observations from 20 stations in 2010 in jiangsu province has been studied .
the result shows that the manual observations are usually higher than automatic ones .
with the increasing soil depth , the difference between automatic and manual observations becomes larger and the correlation decreases with enhanced precipitation .
under relative dry conditions , the variance of manual observations is larger than automatic observations at various depths , and the variance of automatic observations decreases with soil depth increasing .
in general , automatic observations of soil moisture are more accurate than manual observations , and show less variability under precipitation conditions .
a soil drought prediction model has been established by the linear regression method and verified at luhe station
a statistical method based on the combination of singular spectrum analysis ( ssa ) with autoregressive statistical model is applied to reconstruct extended-range forecasts of precipitation from 1961 to 2005 in guangdong .
the results show that the precipitation in guangdong reveals a 40-60 d circle and the correlation coefficient between reconstruction and observation is above 0.96 ;
the forecast results of the other 4 a are good except the fifth pentad forecast in 2003 .
the highest correlation coefficient between extended-range forecast and observation of the first pentad is up to 0.86 and the fifth pentad is above 0.3 .
the average relative mean square errors are smaller than 30 % for the 5 a , which means the prediction is of high credibility and stability by using ssa-ar and has reference value in extended-range forecast
in order to objectively evaluate the wind forecast ability of different models in shandong coastal areas , a wind force forecast verification method , based on the precipitation grading forecast verification , is defined to test the daily strongest wind speed forecast by mm5 , wrf-ruc and t639 models in totally 9 coastal areas of shandong province .
results show that all the models overestimate the weak wind while underestimate the strong one ;
the t639 model &apos;s wind forecast is the lightest so as to be better for wind force scale below 4 , but can hardly forecast for wind force scale above 8 .
mm5 and wrf-ruc model &apos;s wind forecasts are obviously better than the t639 model &apos;s for the wind force scale above 4 , and wrf-ruc &apos;s forecast ability is the best .
however , all the models display a similar weakness : underestimating stronger wind .
the consistency verification of all the models &apos; analysis field and the 24 h wind forecast with respect to the observation shows that the mm5 and wrf-ruc &apos;s wind forecasts are nearly the same as the observation for the wind force scale below 5 , while for the wind over force 6 , forecasts can be either stronger or weaker than the observation .
all in all , the wrf-ruc model &apos; wind forecast is the best in the three models for coastal wind forecast , while the mm5 model is a little unstable in the daily maximum wind speed forecast
the track , structure and cause of precipitation change of typhoon muifa are studied with the conventional data , daily ncep reanalysis data , automatic station data , doppler radar data , as well as the physical characteristics are also diagnostic analyzed .
the results are as follows : when the steering flow in the border of subtropical high is strong , typhoon moves along the steering flow , vice versa ; the main reason why muifa moves westerly is related to the westerly trough .
the invasion of cold air at mid and low-level makes the typhoon &apos;s warm core destructed and transformed from a barotropical structure to a baroclinic one .
the first influence of muifa is originated from peripheral flow of typhoon , the vapour transportation is weaker , but the duration is long , so the accumulative total rainfall is bigger .
the remained cloud system of muifa , the warm and moist flows from southerly monsoon , peripheral flow of typhoon and the cold air are all responsible for the second stage of rainstorm .
in addition , the analysis of radar data and automatic weather station data shows that the mesoscale shear and vortex play a triggering role for the development of convective system
to investigate the raindrop horizontal velocity in wind , the raindrop horizontal moving velocity under different atmospheric conditions was simulated based on the stress of raindrop in wind and the relationship of drag coefficient and reynolds numbers in this paper .
simulation results indicated that the raindrop horizontal velocity is unequal to the velocity of wind , and the raindrop terminal horizontal velocity varies with the raindrop diameter and the velocity of wind ;
the raindrop can reach a steady horizontal velocity in a short period of time ( commonly less than 15 s ) affected by the wind ;
under the same wind condition , the higher the altitude is and the lower the air pressure and environment temperature are , the higher terminal horizontal velocity of raindrop is , and vice versa .
these conclusions are of great practical importance to raindrop image mosaic for automatic optical precipitation-measuring system based on the principle of image acquisition
based on the monthly water level data of lake bosten , runoff of dashankou station and the meteorological data of weather stations in the valley , statistical methods such as fuzzy clustering are used to analyze the characters of monthly variations of water level in lake bosten and its possible mechanism .
the results show that the annual variation of water level in lake bosten is mainly influenced by the runoff of dashankou station . the bigger the runoff of river kaidu is , the higher the water level of lake bosten is . the runoff of river kaidu has close relationship with the temperature and precipitation of upstream and downstream .
the variations of water level in lake bosten can be divided into five categories .
the first type shows a regressive tendency with low seasonal variations , which achieves higher water level in spring but then gradually decreases .
the second type shows an increasing trend with more obvious seasonal variations than the first one , which gets higher water level in later summer and early autumn .
the tendencies of the other three types are relatively special . the main factor that regulates the variation type of water level is the precipitation of the upstream , downstream and the runoff of kaidu . higher precipitation and bigger runoff will make the water level show increasing trend and vice versa
there-fore , we put forward the new prospecting thinking &quot; combine bed with vein , integrate the far with the near ones , tear down the wall and extend the reserves &quot; , adjust the work arrangement , optimize the prospecting target , dis-cover the thick porphyry type mo ( cu ) ore body in the deep finally and confirm the prognosis .
we think that the &quot; triple metallogenesis structure &quot; of laochang ore deposit , lancang is essentially a complete porphyry metallogene-sis series ( system ) .
the metallogenesis period is late yanshanian-early himalayan ( mainly late eocene ) . it is the middle-high t hydrothermal deposit related with the buried rock body in genesis

in this paper , we selectively introduce the ore deposit , sum up the necessary metallogenetic conditions and the prospecting criteria , which have a certain guide significance
a mixed rain-snow storm associated with a strong burst of cold air and development of an extratropical cyclone occurred over north china from 3 to 5 november 2012 .
this early snowfall event was characterized by a dramatic drop in temperature , strong winds , high precipitation intensity , broad spatial extent , and coexistence of multi-phase precipitating hydrometeors .
this study investigates the multi-scale interactions between , the large-scale circulation background and the synoptic-scale weather systems .
( 1 ) the arctic oscillation ( ao ) had been in is negative phase long before the event leading to southward advection of cold air into north china in advance of the storm .
( 2 ) the large-scale atmospheric experienced a decreased number of long waves upstream of north china prior to the storm , resulting in reduced wave velocity and an almost stagnant low pressure system extratropical cyclone over north china .
( 4 ) baroclinic instability at lower levels gave rise to rapid development of the cyclone under the classical &quot; second type &quot; development mechanism for extratropical cyclones .
( 5 ) moisture originated from the yellow sea entered the slowly-moving cyclone in a steady stream , creating fairly favorable water vapor supply for the heavy rainfall-snowfall , especially during the later stage of the cyclone development .
( 6 ) moisture transport and frontal lifting triggered low-level instability and updrafts .
intensification of the front enhanced the vertical wind shear , causing conditional symmetric instability ( csi ) to expand upward within the unstable lower troposphere , and to eventually gear into the csi region of the upper troposphere , which facilitated the upward development of low-level updrafts
the pearl river estuary region is densely covered with rivers . affected by runoff , tide and other natural factors and human activities , the salinity change process during salt water intrusion period is extremely complex .

the results of the analysis shows that the landslide is in unstable state and necessary reinforcement and protection are needed .
through the comparison of the results of the two computing softwares , we can conclude objectively that it is of importance to the analyze the side slope stability
an index to define the days of torrential rain in guangdong was advanced to facilitate automatic judgement by computer using 51-year ( 1961 - 2011 ) 86-station daily precipitation observations of guangdong province .
the variation characteristics of sustained torrential rain during the pre-flooding season and its each month in guangdong were analyzed .
the circulation pattern and the water vapor transport were diagnosed by using daily atmospheric data from ncep-doe reanalysis 2 during1979- 2011 .
it was shown that the present index of torrential rain in guangdong may avoid unreasonable situations of the original index and manual operation .
and the interannual variations of both the number of days and the amount of cumulative rainfall of torrential rain derived from the present index can reflect better the drought and flood situation of guangdong .
the percent of sustained torrential rain is 10 % , 29 % and 61 % in april , may and june respectively averaged over the 51-year . most of sustained torrential rain occurs in may from latter stage of 1960s to 1980s .
but most of sustained torrential rain occurs in june during early and middle stage of 1960s , and during 1990-2011 .
the inter-decadal variation is resulted from the change of atmospheric circulation systems in the middle and low latitudes of east asia .
the intensity and form of troughs ( or ridges ) over each region change with months because of the changing of climate background among the different months , for either the pattern of &quot; 3- ridge and 2- trough &quot; or the pattern of &quot; 2- ridge and 1- trough &quot; .
for example , for the pattern of &quot; 2- ridge and 1- trough &quot; , the high ridge over northeastern asia intensifies and expends northward , the trough over lake baikal widens , the trough east of arabian sea in the middle and low latitudes moves westward , and the trough over bay of bengal and the western pacific subtropical high strengthen month by month from april to june .
the primary origin of water vapor for the sustained torrential rains during the pre-flooding season in guangdong changes with month . the water vapor for the sustained torrential rains comes mostly from the tropical western pacific in april , from both of the tropical western pacific-the south china sea and bay of bengal in may , and from bay of bengal in june .
for all kinds of sustained torrential rain , most parts of guangdong are the convergent area of water vapor flux . this demonstrates that both the dynamic convergence and wa-ter vapor flux are the necessary conditions for the sustained torrential rains .
the sustained torrential rain is resulted from the different types of circulation pattern in the middle and high latitudes together with water vapor transport from the tropics
using the station rain gauge data , the seasonal evolution of precipitation over the central western part of the hengduan mountain has been analyzed .
characteristics of the seasonal evolution over this region are unique . firstly , the rainy season starts early : rainfalls over this region greatly increase from pentad 10 and get the first maximum at pentad 19 .
secondly , the rainy season lasts long , which covers the period from pentad 10 to pentad 60 , for about eight months .
thirdly , the rainy season has three peaks , which occurs at pentad 19,35 and 55 .
by investigating the reanalysis data , the seasonal rainfall evolution is found to be closely linked to the wind fields .
the first peak of the rainy season can be attributed to the enhanced westerly and southerly , especially the westerly .
the second and third peaks of the rainy season are linked to the southwesterly , especially its south wind components .
when the rainfall gets the first peak , the geopotential height at 500 hpa is characterized by the little zonal difference .
the variation of rainfall system is greatly influenced by the westerly .
the second ( third ) peak is associated with the western extension ( eastern retreat ) of subtropical high , when the geopotential height at 500 hpa shows negative zonal gradient . in these two periods , the middle troposphere over this region is controlled by the southwesterly and the rainfall systems are greatly influenced by the southerly

similar increasing trends in the spring , summer and autumn runoff is detected statistically significant while the upward trend in winter runoff is found statistically non-significant .
the grain size parameters are the most important information of sediment which can point out the characteristics of distribution and transportation . a study of the grain size properties distribution of seabed surface sediment in the study sea area is conducted based on 176 samples data which were collected from the sea area of taoziwan bay in oct. 2010 .
at the same time , through the grain size transport analysis model , a conveying trend of sediment has been analyzed .
the results indicate that there are seven sediment types in the taoziwan bay and the main sediment types are silty sand and very fine sand , with percentages of 64.2 % and24 . 4 % , respectively .
surface sediment grain size characteristics changed a little in different periods , which indicate that sedimentary environment of the taoziwan bay is stable . in the different subareas the characteristics of grain size parameters are obviously different due to different hydrodynamic conditions and the sediment movement trend is closely related to hydrodynamic conditions .
the wave action is the main dynamic factor of sedimentary environment in the taoziwan bay . the transverse sediment transport by the waves along the vertical coastline is given priority to sediment transport , and the longitudinal sediment transport strength is not big

a new dynamic approach to retrieving snow depth is developed based on integration of passive microwave remote sensing and in situ data .
first , the snow-cover confidence index is established by use of both the passive microwave remote sensing and in situ data to identify the snow cover ;
second , a new dynamic parameterized scheme ( the distance weighted method ) is developed based on the index .
the characteristics of the snow-depth retrieval approach are as follows : on the one hand , for the difference issue of retrieval coefficients in different spatial-temporal circumstances , a solution is proposed that retrieval coefficients are able to be adjusted according to real-time observed snow depth , which is the biggest difference from static retrieval approaches ;
on the other hand , the advantage of spatial-temporal continuity of the passive microwave remote sensing data has been fully exploited , being able to retrieve the snow depth with relative high resolution and precision in the west china where few stations are located .
in contrast to the static retrieval approach , the dynamic retrieval approach avoids efficiently the question that snow depth was overestimated in mountain regions and underestimated in plain regions
during the mcs intensification period , the extreme rain extent shows oriented southwest-northeast belt shape that is parallel to the orientation of the mountainous terrain , and storm cells embedded in the mcs show distinct training convective elements while the mcs propagates east-southeastward .
a strong outflow is formed in the front of the mcs along the propagation direction , and remarkable and enhancing low-level convergence and updraft are in existence up to 2 km altitude over the foothills , which indicate that terrain forcing and low-level wind convergence play significant roles in raising southerly warm and moist airflow for keeping the durative echo training and promoting the mcs development .
the interaction between the mcs outflow and southerly wind near the surface over the plains has a high effect on intensifying a pre-existent outflow boundary that is near oriented west-southwest-east-northeast and about 50 km apart from the mcs propagation frontage .
the significant positive feedback effect between the low-level vertical wind shear and the mcs evolution is very propitious to the development and maintenance of the long-lived mcs . ( 2 ) the low-level thermo-dynamical fields provide important conditions for the development and propagation of the mcs.low-level warm and moist environment is remarkable in the front of the mcs propagation while distinct cold environment behind the mcs propagation which results from the cold front and precipitation .
the interaction between the clod and warm air has significant influence on high organization of the mcs and the persistence of the extreme rain .

in gaoyou sag of jiangsu oilfield , seismic data quality is influenced by structural factors , such as structure crushing and complex field surface conditions , and the thickness of target sand bodies is often less than the vertical seismic resolution . so single sand body cannot be directly identified from seismic section , and it is very difficult to improve reservoir prediction accuracy using existing seismic data .
high success rate proves that the method is effective in fault-lithologic reservoir exploration
whether there is drilling failure in oil / gas exploration is a controversial topic .
this paper preliminarily defines successful well and failed well from different aspects and different angles of oil / gas exploration .
currently well location arrangement of oil / gas exploration and development is mainly based on seismic exploration results . seismic exploration is a predicative science , and it is normal that there are both success and failure in well arrangement .
anticline trap is the major target of mountainous seismic exploration .
seismic exploration consists of three aspects , i. e. acquisition , processing and interpretation , and deviation in each aspect may result in drilling failure .
poor quality of acquired data may lead to multiple solutions of processing and interpretation , thus causing lower precision of seismic results .
improper processing parameters may result in false structural appearance and mislead interpreters to make wrong decisions .
complex mountainous structure interpretation may cause deviation of horizon calibration , structural modeling and velocity field , resulting in well-to-seismic incoincidence .
analysis on drilling failure means that interpreters timely acquire geologic and log data of drilled wells , use seismic techniques to confirm or correct original results , then carry out corresponding seismic exploration techniques and measures to acquire new seismic results , timely guide drilling work of next step , and maximize oil / gas exploration benefit

compared with daily rainfall amount , hourly rainfall data are able to represent the rainfall intensity and rainfall process more accurately , and thus more suitable for the studies of extreme rainfall events .
the distribution functions of annual maximum hourly rainfall amount for the 321 stations in china are quantified by the generalized extreme value ( gev ) distribution , and the threshold values of hourly intensity for 5-year return period are estimated .
the spatial distributions of the threshold exhibit significant regional differences , with low values in northwestern china and high values in northern china , the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river , the coastal region in southern china , and the sichuan basin .

this paper studied the possible mechanism for the deformation field affecting the occurrence and development of torrential rainfall , from the perspective of the frontogenesis and slantwise vorticity development .
diagnostic study of the &quot; 7.21 &quot; severe rainfall case which occurred in beijing on 21 july 2012 showed that the deformation tick marks had the same orientations or a small angles with the moist potential temperature contours when the rainfall presented in beijing , which implied the local frontogenesis .
the frontogenesis function calculation results showed that the deformation term of the frontogenesis function had a significant contribution to the low-level frontogenesis which induced torrential precipitation in beijing .
the high-level jet stream then accelerated and veered northernly , which resulted in strong high-level divergence and enhancement of severe precipitation in beijing .
the diagnostic results also showed that the vertical vorticity had an explosive growth accompanying the occurrence of severe precipitation .
moreover , in the beijing district , changes in the baroclinicity of the atmosphere had a similar growth trend with the vertical vorticity .
according to the slantwise vorticity development theory , the baroclinicity term associated with the deformation in the complete form of vertical vorticity equation was analyzed .
the results showed that the deformation term driving vertical vorticity had positive values in the vertical vorticity growth areas , which implied that the deformation had a significant contribution in the development of vertical vorticity in the &quot; 7.21 &quot; severe precipitation case .
in view of the deformation drove air contraction in its confluence axis , the moisture flux deformation was introduced to include moisture into the deformation .
it was shown that the low-level positive anomalies of moisture flux deformation corresponded well with the rainfall areas . the moisture flux deformation contained two parts : one was specific humidity advection and the other was deformation .
the deformation determined the basic distribution of moisture flux deformation while the specific humidity advection had more rainfall forecasting implication

the relay sources of this algorithm lie on the shortest passable paths from foreground pixels to background pixels , and thus distance errors are avoided , better than other relay sources suggested in the existing geodesic distance transform algorithms .

many studies have been focused primarily on the impacts of urbanization on regional mean temperatures changes but very little on the changes in extreme temperatures . this paper examined the urbanization impact on extreme summer warmest night temperatures based on the 33 stations in the surrounding bohai area during 1958 _ 2009 .
we then used the generalized extreme value ( gev ) distribution to analyze the distribution of extreme warmest night temperatures and the long term variations of the three distributional characteristics parameters .
the results suggest that among the three extreme minimum temperature distribution parameters , the position parameter is the most representative in terms of its long term change . a new classification method based on the intercommunity ( factors analysis method ) of the temperature change is developed to detect the urbanization effect on summer extreme warmest night temperatures in different cities .
during the period of rapid urbanization ( after1980 ) , the magnitude of variations of the three distribution parameters for the urban station group is larger than that for the reference station group , indicating a higher chance of occurrence of warmer weather and a larger fluctuation of temperatures .
among different types of cities , the three parameters of the extreme warmest night temperature distribution of the urban station group are , without exception , higher than those of the reference station group . the urbanization of the different types of cities all show an urban heat island effect , with an average effect about 0.3 ° c / ( 10 a ) in the surrounding bohai area
the surface thermal anomalies ( sta ) in the large orography have important influences on the climate . previous studies were focused on the effects of the sta in the tibetan plateau on the weather and climate in china with less attention paid to the connection between the sta in the iran plateau and the precipitation in the arid regions , especially in xinjiang .
by use of the ncep / ncar reanalysis monthly mean data and the precipitation data at the 43 stations in north xinjiang , the relationships between the anomalies of surface sensible heat in the tibetan plateau and iran plateau and the summertime precipitation in north xinjiang were analyzed .
by singular value decomposition ( svd ) method , they were found that the sensible heat in the tibetan plateau has a negative correlation with summertime precipitation in north xinjiang , and it in the iran plateau has a positive correlation with summertime precipitation .
the anomaly contrast of surface sensible heat between the tibetan plateau and the iran plateau has a closer relation than that in any single region with summertime precipitation in north xinjiang . therefore , an index is defined to reflect the intensity of the large-scale thermal contrast between the two plateaus .
further analysis found that the thermal anomalies in the tibetan plateau have closer relations with the mid-upper troposphere circulations , but the thermal anomalies in the iran plateau have closer relations with the water vapor flux
computational performance of the positive-definite shape-preserving conservative semi-lagrangian with rational function advection ( cslr ) scheme is analyzed through a couple of idealized experiments in cartesian plane coordinates and the spherical yin-yang coordinate system .
numerical convergence rate of the cslr scheme is studied by using several error norms in both one- and two-dimensional computations .
the numerical results reveal that the rational function adopted in the cslr scheme eliminates numerical oscillation at discontinuous points , guarantees positive definition and acquires the lst-2nd-order convergence rate in case of smooth distribution .
at discontinuous points or steep-slope regions , in addition to the application of the multi-dimensional splitting algorithm , however , the convergence rate is reduced due to the special character of rational function . the convergence rate of the cslr scheme decreases in the spherical coordinate because of the spherical curvature
surface fluxes simulated by both the simple biosphere model ( sib ) version 2 and 3 , respectively are compared to the eddy covariance observations at the sites of naqu and anduo in the tibet plateau and of suzhou in the yangtze delta region , for analyzing the reasons of differences between sib2 / sib3 and observations , and thus realizing the above areas surface energy budget characteristics .
the results show that both sib2 and sib3 simulated surface energy fluxes were in very good agreements as compared to field observations .
simulation of the sensible heat fluxes at naqu and ando sites using sib3 is closer to the observations than that using sib2 , but in suzhou sites , closer using sib2 than that using sib3 .
simulations of the diurnal variation of the latent heat fluxes using sib3 , are more consistent with the observations , comparing with sib2 .
the correlation coefficients between sib3 simulated and observed values , are above 0.8 except suzhou site .
sib2 and sib3 simulations of the ground heat flux were compared with the observed with the correlation above 0.8 .
both sib2 and sib3 simulated the net radiation flux reasonably , where the correlations between simulated and observed values are generally about 1.0 .
compared to sib2 , a soil representation based on the common land model and the prognostic calculation of temperature , moisture and trace gases in the canopy air space have been added in sib3 , which resulted in that sib3 simulates the latent heat flux and ground heat flux better , but not obvious in simulating the sensible heat flux and net radiation flux over the complex underlying surface
calculation of surface layer turbulent fluxes is very important for atmosphere numerical models .
how to parameterize the turbulent fluxes is one of the key research questions in current atmosphere boundary layer study .
the paper uses two common schemes ( mm5 similarity non-iterative scheme a and eta similarity iterative scheme b ) in the weather research forecast model ( wrf ) to make offline test and intercomparison of the parameterization results with the pbl eddy-correlation observation .
the aerodynamic roughness length ( z0 ) obtained on the dali boundary layer is determined before calculating the turbulent fluxes . the aerodynamic roughness length ( z0 ) by fitting four different heights wind speed from the pbl tower data under neutral condition varies significantly with season due to the obvious changes in underlaying surface conditions during the whole year ( horsebean in winter half year and paddy in summer half year ) .
the results show that the vegetation sparseness degree has a significant effect on turbulent fluxes calculation in the dali cropland .
in the unstable condition , scheme b underestimates the momentum flux , and scheme a is superior to scheme b.conversely , in the stable condition , scheme a generates lower values with scheme b is superior to scheme a.on the whole , both of them produce little error .
scheme b takes account of the difference between aerodynamic roughness length ( z0 ) and heat roughness length ( zoh ) .
the sensible heat flux result of scheme b is much better than that of scheme a , especially for the bare soil or sparse vegetation underlaying in the unstable condition .
in case of bare soil the calculated sensible heat flux by scheme b is still larger than the observation . the result is much better , if the ( zeng , et al , 1998 ) &apos; s method using the radiometric surface temperature is adopted
dust emissions caused by local terrain have an important effect on forecast precision of dust model .
at last , three sets of ideal experiments were applied to test the narrow-pipe effect , downslide effect and superposition of both effects .
the experiments show that as to narrow-pipe effect , the velocity in the narrow pipe saltation flux and the emissions will increase ( decrease ) when wind flows in from the wide ( narrow ) entrance and flow out from the narrow ( wide ) exit of the pipe .
while as to the downslide effect , the velocity saltation flux and the emissions increase , too and the increasing amounts at hill foot are bigger than those at hillside .
as far as the superposition of both effects is concerned , when wind flows in from the wide end and flow out from the narrow end , the velocity saltation flux and the emissions also increase , with the velocity at hill foot bigger than that at hillside and the saltation flux associated with big-sized grains of sand bigger than those associated with small-sized grains .
on the contrary , when wind flows in from the narrow end and flow out from the wide end , there exists a threshold value for the ratio of exits width to entrance &apos;s .
when beyond it , the velocity decreases otherwise the velocity increases .
furthermore , the saltation flux will decrease except for the case in which there are small-sized grains located on hill foot
the performance of a one-dimensional ( 1d ) thermal diffusion lake model for lake taihu has been examined using observations from august 11 to 28,2010 .
the originally simulated lake surface temperature has significant biases , and the simulated temperature diurnal cycle range is smaller than observations .
the new lake model using the new parameters has greatly improved the temperature simulations when compared with observations and original simulations .
the vertical thermal structure in lake taihu is well reproduced using the three new parameters in the lake model . the simulated sensible flux and latent heat flux are also improved significantly .
a series of sensitivity tests were performed to determine the critical meteorological variables ( solar radiation , air temperature , and wind ) affecting the simulations of water temperature . thus , a ± 10 % error has been exerted in these three main meteorological variables , and the result shows that this lake model is not very sensitive to those meteorological variables .
by contrast , this lake model is less sensitive to the winds , the sensitivity is almost the same for the other two variables
whether or not relatively higher latitude areas , say in the northern south china sea , can become coral refuges under global warming is not clear , due to limited study cases .
in this paper , we determined the skeletal extension rate of porites corals collected around weizhou island using x-ray photography .
using sea surface temperature ( sst ) data recorded at weizhou island , we calculated the degree heating weeks ( dhw ) and the positive and negative sst _ anomalies ( ± sst anomalies ) , which revealed historical extreme high and low temperature events more clearly .
we combined coral skeletal extension rate with the sst _ anomalies and dhw and analyzed the variation of skeletal extension rate in response to global warming and increase of extreme events , and further explored the ‘ refuge theory ’ in the relatively higher latitude corals from the northern south china sea .
the porites corals were 27 years old , from 1984 to 2010 .
the skeletal growth rates ranged from 3.1 to 9.9 mm · year ? 1 , with an averaged rate of 6.3 mm · year ? 1 .
the variation of skeletal growth rate for all porites corals collected consistently showed a downward trend , especially after 1997 , decreased by 26 % compared to the previous years from 1984 ? 1997 .
global warming , rapidly increasing sst , and increased extreme events caused the decline of skeletal growth rate of global corals , including corals from weizhou island .
to study the circulation and distribution of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients in xiangshan bay , zhejiang , china ( to the west of 122 ° 00&apos;e ) , concentrations of nitrate nitrogen ( no3-n ) , nitrite nitrogen ( no2-n ) , ammonium nitrogen ( nh4-n ) and phosphate ( po4-p ) were studied in six stations from 1992 to 2007 .
results showed that : ( 1 ) the concentrations , especially those of po4-p and no2-n , declined overall from stations 1 to 6 in the 16 years ;
( 2 ) the distribution of no3-n was more complicated than others , and often with the maximum at station 3 ;
( 3 ) whether in dry ( april ) or wet season ( july ) , the salinity at all stations was lower at surface and high at the bottom , and it was warmer at surface than at the bottom .
the salinity increased from stations 1 to 6 , while the tendency of temperature was reversed .
the distribution could be explained with a residual circulation mode that the nutrients accumulated in the xihu bay mostly enter the inner section of the xiangshan bay ( to the west of no .
1 section features a gravitational nature , its direction at the bottom is westward and at the surface eastward ; therefore , nutrients are transported constantly to the surface layer , pass eastward across the no. 2 section , and then leave the bay mouth . however , tide-wave action contributes greatly in addition to the residual circulation ;
( 4 ) the concentrations of no3-n and po4-p at all stations in 2007 nearly and more than doubled from those of 1992 , respectively , indicating a worsening trend of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution in xiangshan bay
the zijinshan mining field , which is dominated by the zijin copper-gold deposit , is the first high- sulfide epithermal deposit discovered in china .
the porphyry copper ( molydenum ) deposit , the meso-low-temperature hydrothermal copper deposit , the lower- sulfide epithermal silver ( gold-copper ) deposit , the volcanic uranium deposit and the high-temperature hydrothermal tungsten ( tin ) geochemistry abnormity were discovered in the depth and vicinity of the deposit .
from late jurassic , it had gone through multiphase-tectonic movement , magmation and hydrothermal alteration , which had resulted in multiphase-mineralization .
this paper points out that the mineralization system of the zijinshan mining field is characterized by tectonic structure , body within body , altered alteration , mineralized mineralization , and by a vertical zonation of minerlization : &quot; u 、 ag → au → au 、 cu → cu → cu 、 mo → w 、 sn &quot; from top to bottom , and a &quot; multi-storey &quot; metallogenic model .
the different deposit types show laterally-distributed patterns spatially , forming a unique zijin-typed metallogenic series and minerization .
compared with other deposits , it is likely that the porphyry copper ( molydenum ) deposit and the high-temperature hydrothermal tungsten ( tin ) may exist at the depth of the porphyry copper ( molydenum ) deposit and its vicinity respectively . the research shows that there will be a new exploration field in the mining field and provides a scientific base for further exploration
groundwater levels in a coastal leaky confined aquifer may fluctuate as a result of the induction of the tide .
a numerical model describing 1d groundwater flow in a coastal leaky confined aquifer is established in this paper based on the finite element method .
by simplifying the fluctuation in the tide as a sinusoidal wave , groundwater level oscillations in a coastal leaky confined aquifer with horizontal and linear slope initial ground-water levels are modeled .
comparison of the modeling results of these two cases shows that the groundwater le-vel oscillations induced by the tide in the coastal confined aquifer are similar to those of the tide but the fluctua-tion ranges of groundwater levels are smaller than those of the tide .
the degree of effect by the tide is related to distance from the coast . the fluctuation range of groundwater levels and the tidal efficiency decrease negatively exponentially with the distance from the coast .
because of the influence of tidal fluctuations , determination of aquifer parameters by using methods of pumping tests and recovery of groundwater levels becomes difficult and costs more in coastal areas .
in this pa-per , through the study of the dynamic data of groundwater levels in the coastal aquifer in beihai , guangxi , we find that the rising and falling sections of the tide are asymmetrical .
based on the theory of the propagation of the sinusoidal tidal wave in confined aquifers , we provide a segmentation method to calculate the parameter of the aquifer , and compare the result with the those of the swing attenuation method and the time lag method .
the ratios of storativity to transmissivity calculated with the three methods are close . this shows that the segmenta-tion method is effective .
using the remote sensing image of etm + data , this paper carried out the scale 1 ∶ 250,000 hydroge-ology investigation of wenquan sheet in karakoram range .
the vital interpreting indexes were adequately identified on the basis of the image of various geological units , combined with comparison of the previous field investigation researches .
accordingly , the primary visual interpretations to major sediments , geomorphology and water system were studied and the scale 1 ∶ 250,000 rs interpretation map of cenozoic strata was obtained .
moreover , the genetic type and distribution of quaternary sediments , geomorphologic characteristics and hydro-geology signs , i. e. rivers , lakes , spring spots , groundwater overflow zones , wetlands and so on , were dis-cussed respectively .
the different forming environments of the groundwater resources reveal that the systems have two types , i .
the alluvium and diluvium groundwater of river vale in the south and the flows-in lake basin groundwater in the north .
the alluvium and diluvium groundwater system has better reserve condition , and the supplement of water resources is abundant , so that its groundwater and surface water resources constitute a unified system ;
but the flow-in lake basin area mostly consists of lacustrine-facies sediments and is affected by &amp; nbsp ;
the weather , so the groundwater resources are indigence except the giant several alluvial-pluvial sediment fans with enough groundwater resources .
basement rocks occur in the northwestern corner of the qaidam basin and piedmont deposits and al-luvial and lacustrine sediments prevail in the western basin . several nw-se trending anticlines of different sizes occur in the cenozoic sediments in the western basin . k + -rich brines have been found in the neogene sedi-ments in the western qaidam basin .
in this paper , statistic methods are used to examine the enrichment of tds , k + and b2 o3 of the subsurface brines .
the results show that the tds of the brines are of bi-peak values and the brines are rich in k + and b3 + with enrichment probabilities of 62.8 % and 61.29 % , respectively .
when the piper diagram is used to study brine samples , the data points are usually too concentrated to show the changes of the main ions .
the previous methods are modified to express hydrochemistry of subsurface brines .
ratios of na + to cl - , cl - to br - , cl - to i - , k + to cl - , so2 -4 to cl - and ca2 + to mg2 + are employed to ana-lyze the brine samples , indicating that most of the brine samples are not saturated with respect to halite and only a small number of the brine samples are saturated with respect to halite .
the δ18 o and δd of the brine samples &amp; nbsp ; in the study area show both the 18 o shift and the d shift , indicating a long time evaporation and concentration of the brines . the subsurface brines originated from the paleo-meteoric water of neogene age .
the qaidam basin uplifted and its subsidence center moved eastwards due to the quick uplift of the qinghai-tibet plateau after pli-ocene .
the renacuo area of gaize , tibet , in the southern qiangtang basin , shows a series of strikingly thick carbonate layers .
research on c and o isotopes in the area plays an important role in the reconstruction of the paleoenvironment and the identification of the sedimentary characteristics .
based on the geological map of the lithostratigraphy ( 1 ∶ 2,000 ) , the numerous samples collected in the field and analysis of the c and o isotopes , the z values of salinity from 126.32 to 135.37 , which indicates that the paleoseawater in the renacuo area of gaize ranges from normal marine to hypersaline .
in addition , the average temperature of the paleoseawater is 22.4 ℃ , firm evidence of a warm climate .
the geochemical information from trace elements of the continental shelf sediment from east china sea is a significant indicator to the stratigraphic division and provenance analysis .
the trace elements of sedi-ments derived from drillhole sfk-1 ( 82.90 meters in depth ) which was located at xihu depression in the conti-nental shelf of east china sea were analyzed and their provenances were discriminated .
according to the chan-ging law of trace element contents and their ratios , the sediments from drillhole sfk-1 can be divided into eight layers , which reflect the fluctuation of sea level and the change of sediment sources in east china sea since the late last interglacial cycle ( warm period ) .
the dishuigou dioritic intrusion is located in the langshan arc at the northern margin of the north china craton ( ncc ) , inner mongolia .
it is emplaced in the late carboniferous-early permian according to the previous zircon u-pb dating data .
in this paper , the major and trace ( including rare earth ) elements composi-tion of the dishuigou diorite are reported .
the result shows relatively enriched in large ion lithophile elements ( lile ) such as the rb , ba , th , k , and p , and depleted in high field strength elements ( hfse ) such as the nb , ta , and ti , and high rb / sr ( 0.05 -0.10 ) and ba / rb ( 11.45 -22.16 ) values , and low a / cnk ( &lt; 1.1 ) .
in combination with the strong fractionation ree ( lree / hree = 2.97 -3.31 ) and lree ( la / sm = 2.75 -3.57 ) , and insignificant eu anomalies ( δeu = 0.92 -1.13 ) , suggesting the dioritic intrusion formed in an arc environment and derived from mantle melt mixed with crust material during ascending .
the luchun massive sulfide deposit is located in the luchun-hongponiuchang rift basin .
the lu-chun copper deposit occurs in a series of bimodal volcanic rocks which are dominated by acidic volcanics . there are upper and lower orebodies in the ore district : the upper is black and lower is yellow . the assemblage of minerals , with higher contents of sphalerite , galena and chalcopyrite , is simple .
trace elements and rees geo-chemical data on the minerals are similar to the volcanics . the result of sulfur isotopic analyses shows that the 34 s values vary from 11.5 ‰ to 17.8 ‰ .
ore lead isotopic compositions are rather uniform , as evidenced by the pb isotopic ratios : 206 pb / 204 pb = 18.498 to 18.626 ; 207 pb / 204 pb = 15.588 to 15.760 ; 208 pb / 204 pb = 38.430 to 38.974 .
it is clear that the evolution history of the rift basin . and the bimodal volcanics in the basin are typical of oceanic ridges or intraplate extensional settings and island arc , it suggests that the tectonic setting in this area &amp; nbsp ; is extensional and rifting .
haojiahe copper deposit is a typical representative of sandstone deposits in chuxiong basin , yun-nan .
on the basis of large scale tectonic geological mapping , this article uses the theory and method of ore fields of geomechanics to select the typical fractures to identify the mechanical properties of fracture surface , divides the construction period of time and set the tectonic systems , and also makes a detailed description on the rela-tionship between the geological characteristics of the faulted geology and the ore-forming in different period time and from different direction .
since yanshanian , this area has experienced the transition from ne -sw trending → near ew trending → nw -se trending → near s -n trending to the main constructional compressive stress .
in late yanshanian , nw trending structure has control function on the inchoate metallogenic material activation , migration and reconfiguration and enrichment of copper ;
between late yanshanian and early himalayan , near s-n trending structure prompted into enrichment of metallogenic material . the morphology of ore body emerged to be lamellar and stratoid ;
in the early himalayan , ne trending structure promoted the ore fluid to extract a great number of mineral substance then enriched them again and formed rich ore body ;

then , we analyzed the stress field by system clustering and average focal mechanism of alashan region ( i ) and yinchuan basin and its northern region ( ii ) by grid testing method .
the results show that 77 % of 31 earthquakes are strike-slip earthquakes and seismic dislocation mode is mainly strike-slip mode in ningxia northern region and neighboring areas .
implementation of co2 capture and sequestration has currently been proposed as an effective way to reduce co2 emissions and alleviate greenhouse effect .
co2 mineral sequestration is the most secure and stable way among all the geological storage types and basalt has been identified as a potential host formation .

the related parameters in the model were calculated through least square method . model verification were conducted using the model predicted value and experimental value under 57 ℃ , 72 ℃ , 92 ℃ , respectively .

metal-poor stars are long-lived objects which were formed in the early universe .
these stars are crucial to our understanding of the early evolution of the galaxy .
it has been noticed that the li abundance of metal-poor , near main-sequence turn-off stars seems independent of the metallicity and effective temperature in the temperature range teff = 5700 ~ 6250 k , which is called spite plateau .
based on larger sample of metal-poor stars , trends of li abundance with teff and &#91; fe / h &#93; have been found .
there is no final conclusion of the cause of the slope . analysis of li abundances of the metal-poor halo stars shows that the spite plateau does not exist anymore at the lowest metallicities ; instead , the li abundance decreases sharply at lower metallicities , and shows increased scatter .
two explanations are proposed : ( 1 ) the uncertainties of the li abundance were dominated by the uncertainty of the stellar atmospheric parameters ;
( 2 ) li could have been destroyed in some metal-poor stars .
the mean abundance of the spite plateau lies below the value that has been predicted from the results of wmap , interpreted in terms of the predictions of sbbn . the detailed understanding of the physics responsible for the difference between them is still lacking . because metal-poor stars were born in early universe , their li abundance is close to the primordial value which is a key prediction of models of big bang nucleosynthesis .
the interior structure of terrestrial planets is fundamental to the understanding of the solar system and for the comprehension of the formation and evolution of those planets .
furthermore , knowledge about terrestrial planets provides important insights to the understanding of the future evolution of the earth . here two methods , forward method and bayesian inversion , which construct interior structure models applicable to terrestrial planets are introduced .
in order to get the detail interior structure model , planets are divided into three parts : crust , mantle and core , and each part has its own composition .

we mainly present the dependence of sne ia rate and luminosity on their host galaxies . firstly , we show that the host galaxy mass is lower or host star-formation rate is higher , sne ia rate will be larger .
secondly , we show that before light-curve correction , dimmer sne ia fluently occur in higher mass , higher star-formation rate , higher metal abundance , or older stellar galaxy system .
however , after light-curve correction , brighter sne ia fluently occur in higher mass , higher star-formation rate , higher metal abundance , or older stellar galaxy system .
higher-metallicity pro-genitors are more neutron rich , producing more stable burning products relative to radioactive 56ni .
since sne ia explosions are powered by the radioactive decay 56ni , it is widely accepted that the intrinsic variation in sne ia brightness and decline rate is primarily driven by the amount of 56ni present in sne explosion , where more luminous and much slowly declining explosions are powered by more 56ni , hence , under higher-metallicity circumstances , sne ia are dimmer .
whereas , after light-curve correction , sne ia in higher-metallicity progenitors are brighter .

in this paper , the variabilities of mrk 421 and 3c 454.3 are analyzed in detail .
we collect the data inγ-ray ( 100 mev ~ 300 gev ) and radio ( 15 ghz ) bands , and construct their light curves . through analysis , we find that there is a strong correlation betweenγ-ray and radio fluxes , in which the variation in theγ-ray band leads that in radio band for two sources .
the most likely explanation of the observed time lag is synchrotron opacity in the radiation region which could be optically thick to radio emission when the flares occur .
caused by the same perturbation , the radio andγ-ray flares at their peaks are not observed simultaneously due to the opacity effect . the radio flare is observed only when the emission region becomes optically thin . we also find a long time fall in the light curve of 3c 454.3 in radio band after a big outburst .
in the same time , theγ-ray flux is very faint , indicating the weakness of the activity of the jet .

through the theory and technology of high resolution sequence stratigraphy , we identify two super long-terms and five long-terms of datum base-level cycles sequences in the xujiahe formation .
using the sedimentary theory as a guidance , we choose the long-term base-level cycle se-quences as isochronal stratigraphic units to map sequence-lithofacies paleogeography of sichuan basin .
sedimentary facies of taiyuan formation , which is mainly featured by limestones along with in-terlayered siltstones , mud shales and coal seams , can be divided into five facies including open carbonate plat-form , limited carbonate platform , barrier island , lagoon-swamp and tidal-flat facies . the storm depositional events widely developed in the carbonate platform , which can be divided into several sedimentary cycles .
open carbonate platform ( mainly in yuzhou area ) mainly contain amount of bioclastic , featured by substantial broken fossils , high content of trace elements and rare earth elements , much higher content of lree than that of hree , the respectively positive correlations between the value of ∑ ree and the content of fe as well as between that of lree / hree and fe .
compared with open carbonate platform , restricted carbonate platform ( mainly in jiaozuo area ) is featured by the widespread micrite , which infer that the ancient ocean in the restricted carbonate platform contained less fossils and colloids , and became much more restricted and quieter than that of open carbonate platform .
the bottom limestones of the lower limestone section of taiyuan forma-tion , which is formed in transgressive systems tract ( tst ) during the early phase of first transgression , are fea-tured by high content of biodetritus , sc , ba and ∑ ree , low value of sr / ba , low differentiation between lree &amp; nbsp ;
and hree.the top limestones of the lower limestone section formed in highstand systems tract ( hst ) , which reflected the sedimentary environment of the limited carbonate platform in the research area evolving from the previous turbulent water into confined and quite surroundings with biodetritus and collides diminishing and evaporation strengthening .
beizhan iron ores is the representative metallogenic region with typical genetic type and good metallogenic conditions in the awulale iron belt .
the previous research results indicate that petroleum in the ordos basin is enriched mainly in the yan-chang and jurassic formations , gas mainly in the lower paleozoic reservoir , and coal mainly in the sequences from carboniferous to jurassic .
a number of geologic , logging and core data indicates that uranium is enriched in the ordovician sequence , and from carboniferous to cretaceous deposits . the occurrences of uranium vary in the deep and shallow sequences of the basin . the deep sequence is characterized by high gamma ray anomaly , which probably results from high uranium abundance .
research on the fault structure and its distribution shows a great possibility of well developed fracture system in the ordos basin , which plays an important role in u distribution .
this research also indicates that the basin had undergone tectonic movement and sedimentary environmental change , all of which restrain the occurrences of multiple resources such as petroleum , gas and coal which are all attributed to the enrichment of uranium .
furthermore , the abundance of organic material is closely related to uranium anomaly

using tele-seismograms from four stations ( langga station , bengga station , zhibai station and lage station ) for about five months in the central namche barwa , eastern himalayan syntaxis in tibet , we calculated receiver functions by time-domain iterative deconvolution technique and selected high-quality receiver functions with similar epicentral distances and back azimuths and then stacked them .
magnetotelluric apparent resistivity and phase curves are obtained by rhoplus analysis of berdichevskiy invariant of impedance tensors .
the average receiver function and apparent resistivity and phase data from the same station are jointly inverted for one-dimensional earth to infer lithospheric structure .
using genetic algorithm , we analyzed the compatibility between the magnetotelluric data and the seismic data by trade-off plots .
the comparison of predicted data and measured data manifests that they coincide on both data sets .
the results demonstrate : ( 1 ) in the mid-upper crust , a high resistivity , high velocity layer ( 9 ~ 14 km thickness ) overlays a low resistivity and low velocity layer which may be related to aqueous fluids and partial melts .
( 2 ) there exists a highly conductive crust-mantle transition layer ( thickness &lt; 20 km ) with the s wave velocity of ~ 4 km / s in the lower crust , and also exists the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary deeper than 130 ~ 150 km in the upper mantle .
( 3 ) a possible interpretation about the high resistivity and high velocity layer in the upper crust is the migmatitic amphibolite facies ( duoxiongla formation ) , while the low resistivity , low velocity layer beneath the zhibai station is associated with partial melting .
and high-pressure granulite facies may originate from petrological transformation of mafic rocks in the crust-mantle transition layer or from mantle-derived magma underplating
lamproite is the mother rock of diamond , and it is the basic substance for forming pipe .
this work is based on the features of the regional gravitational and magnetic anomalies in the southeast of guizhou province , and the clues of exposed lamproite in zhenyuan county and adjacent counties ( shibing , sansui , leishan , jianhe and majiang ) and basic-ultrabasic rocks in the congjiang area in the south .

integrated with the magmatite belt , volcano institution , plate conjunction belt , and deep fault zones derived from geophysical and geological data , this work determines 6 prospecting areas for searching diamond .
it is inferred that in the taijiang-jianhe-jinping-liping areas , one large-scale gravitational and magnetic positive anomaly area should be regarded as a very important target area for diamond search and a key breakthrough spot for seeking original diamond mineral with industry values .
and its anomaly area g3 is very likely the critical place to find original diamond mineral in guizhou province as well as the favorable section to remove the mystery veil of diamond deposits with pipes

the co 2 storage in oil reservoirs is one of the most effective ways of reducing the greenhouse gas emission , which is based on the mechanisms of structural and stratigraphic trapping , residual gas trapping , dissolution trapping and mineral trapping .
the universal pyramid method is introduced to assess the co 2 storage capacity for the oil reservoirs .
subei basin has many oil reservoirs with low permeability and water content . dongtai sag is better than yancheng-funing sag on the co 2 storage potential .
gaoyou depression and jinhu depression have the greatest potential of co 2 storage among the secondary geological units . a series of the small tectonic units in this area are more suitable for co 2 storage , and beneficial to the preservation of late stage .

the lower cap rocks of upper cretaceous system and paleocene series have better sealing capabily than the upper cap rocks of the eocene epoch .
based on analyzing the mechanism of co 2 storage in oil reservoirs and combining with geological and structural conditions of subei basin , we estimated that the theoretical storage capacities of co 2 is 1.5054 * 10 8 t and the effective storage capacities of co 2 is 0.0828 * 10 8 t ~ 0.4421 * 10 8 t , which shows the great potential of co 2 storage in subei basin , jiangsu province

deep-penetrating geochemistry is one of the exploration techniques to detect elemental information contained in the surface soils and transported through the covering of the concealed deposit . the selective leaching of mobile forms of elements is one of the most popular techniques .
since the contents of mobile forms of elements are always at the trace level , valuable information is easily concealed by the analytical errors caused from the complex leaching and determination procedures .
at present , research on the leaching conditions is limited , and the degree of standardization of methods is poor .
experiments have been conducted for leaching conditions of determination for mobile forms of copper in deep-penetrating geochemical samples and are described here .
the analytical parameters include solid-liquid mixing ratio , extraction time , ph , solid-liquid separation method and extraction temperature , as well as the determination method for extraction solution .
the copper in leached solution was determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry ( icp-ms ) with detection limit of 0.03 μg / g and rsd of 4.95 % -7.39 % . the method was simple and highly accurate .
the method was applied in one buried cu-ni deposit in henan province and the results were obtained from the contents of total cu and mobile cu , showing that the delineated anomalies were consistent with the actual ore bodies
aimed at the two drawbacks of hail algorithm ( 88d ) : the high false acceptance rate ( far ) and the limited revisable parameters , an automatic warning ( aw ) technology which can distinguish the strong convection cloud and release the warning signal automatically is in- troduced in this paper .
using the base data of volume scanning of radar , the aw technology is applied to 12 strong convection weather pro- cesses in the east of tibetan plateau in 2010 and then the data gotten by the aw technology is compared with the data gotten by manual warn- ing based on products of 88d . the results show that the data handling efficiency and warning accuracy of aw are considerably higher than that of manual warning .
the aw release time is 25 minutes earlier than the occurrence time of the actual weather on an average .
the precipi- tation accuracy of aw is 91 % , far is 9 % while the precipitation accuracy of manual warning is 75 % . in term of hail events , the accuracies of both aw and manual warning are 100 % .
in conclusion , the accuracy of short-time strong convective weather forecasting and warning would be further improved and the degree of automation of short-time weather forecasting would be developed through putting the aw technology into algorithm ( 88d ) as an assisted technology

the central canyon in the qiongdongnan basin shows a s-shaped ne-trending depositional system , which originates from the east margin of the yinggehai basin , crosses the central depression and extends into the xisha trough .
based on the detailed interpretation of 2d and 3d seismic data and drillhole data , the central canyon can be divided into 4 segments . each segment has not only different morphology in section , but also has distinct depositional architectures , genetic facies and sediment-supplies .
analysis of morphology and infilling features indicates that the canyon shows the deeper downcutting and scours to the older strata eastwards .
there are 4 types of v , u , w and composed shapes in vertical .
of them , v-typed canyon shows the strongest downcutting , and the more significant scouring .
turbidite channel deposits are dominated in the western segment . interbeds of turbidite channel and mass transport deposits occur in the eastern segment , but there are different ratios in different places .
turbidite channel deposits originate from the west side , however , mass transport deposits originate from the slope system in the northern side of the basin .
those deposits from different sediment-supplies are composed of a multiple-episodic and multiple sediment-supplied complex canyon system
&quot; carbonaceous sand slate &quot; in deerni area is a rock name used for more than 30 years , because this kind of rock is irrelevant to mineralization .
through detailed research work , the authors discovered that this kind of rock can be divided into two kinds : one is terrigenous clastic rock , which is a kind of normal sedimentary rock , i .
, carbonaceous sandy slate , having no direct relationship with mineralization , whereas the other is exhalative rock formed by submarine exhalation-ferro-siliceous rock .
it is thus inferred that the deerni large-size co-cu deposit was mainly formed by submarine exhalative-sedimentation and was later enriched by superimposition of multi-stage mineralization .
this discovery has important theoretical and guiding significance in search for such ore deposits in deerni area

the nanling area is famous for its widely distributed granites , however , there are also many mafic to ultra-mafic intrusion , lujing kimberlite-like rock ( kimberlitic lamprophyre ) , located in caifang town , anyuan country of south jiangxi province , being one of these intrusions .
based on a field survey , we investigated the rock formation time of lujing by shrimp zircon u-pb dating , and determined its age as 132.0 ma ( range in 128.7-135.4 ma ) .
meanwhile , early xenocryst of 1945 ma old was found , which indicates that there is a palaeoproterozoic basement in the south jiangxi area .
firstly , this result revises the previous determination of the lujing kimberlite-like rock as caenozoic by k-ar and rb-sr dating method , and provides new correct data for investigating the evolutionary history of tectonic structures of the south jiangxi area .
secondly , this result indicates that the transformation of the tectonic system in the late yanshanian period is related to the interaction of crust and mantle , and the magma of the lujing kimberlite-like rock may have originated from enriched mantle
the wenquan mo deposit , western qinling is intimately associated with the late triassic continental collisional orogenesis and magmatism in the qinling orogenic belt ( qob ) .
the result suggests that the ore-forming fluid in this deposit is magmatic-hydrothermal fluid which originated from the magma of mo-bearing granite .
the wenquan mo deposit shows a characteristic of magmatic-hydrothermal quartz vein-type .
the ore-forming process can be summarized as follows . in the late triassic , tectonic setting transition from compression to extension in qob resulted in partial melting of lower crust , forming mo-bearing granitoids .
the ore-forming fluid was generated during the late phases of magma crystallization , filled the joints or replaced the host rocks to produce the late triassic wenquan mo deposit

based on systematic studies , sodium persulfate has a photochemical reaction to oxidize humic acid under alkaline conditions .
the photochemical dynamic curve of na2s2o8-humic acid system has been established .
the reaction conditions were optimized for negative high voltage , gain , pump speed , na2s2o8 and naoh concentration .
a new photochemical analysis method to determine humic acid in loess has been established with a linear range from 0.1 mg / l to 500 mg / l ( r = 0.9985 ) and a detection limit of 0.076 mg / l.eleven replicate determinations were conducted on 0.5 mg / l humic acid , and the calculated relative standard deviation ( rsd ) was 3.47 % .
according to the determinations of humic acid from 5 different groundwater samples with an internal calibration , the standard recovery rates of the samples were between 98.33 % and 107.50 % .
this method was successful in the determination of humic acid without any separation
selecting a classic height-based terrain-following coordinate ( hereafter as gal-c . s. coordinate ) and a new smoothed level verti- cal height-based terrain-following coordinate ( hereafter as sleve1 coordinate ) , the numerical simulations for a severe precipitation process and the comparative analysis on effects of two kinds of terrain-following coordinates on the simulating results were performed with the grapes _ meso regional model .
numerical simulations of the severe precipitation process show that the grapes _ meso model using sleve 1 coordinate could improve the accuracy of the pgf ( pressure gradient force ) calculations and the elements forecasts such as precipitation , wind , temperature and geopotential height .
comparing with gal . c.s coordinate , sleve1 coordinate reduced the hypocritical precipitation caused by the hypocritical vertical velocity through smoothing the topographic factors in the coordinate planes .
the small-scale noise in the isoclines was decayed to a certain degree in the vertical cross section of the elements of sleve1 coordinate , so the rms errors were reduced and the correlation coefficients were increased .
besides , the smaller the critical decaying height of sleve 1 coordinate was , the better the simulation results were . the critical decaying height of sleve1 coordinate is bound by the maximum terrain height

due to the refractory feature of corundum , secondary melting was adopted to decompose samples .
the solution was then lixiviated by hcl and subsequently measured by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry ( icp-aes ) to determine the contents of silicon , iron , titanium , calcium , magnesium and zirconium .
boracic acid-sodium carbonate ( mass ratio = 2 ∶ 1 ) was added as the fluxing agent .
the large amount of boracic acid in the flux can completely decompose corundum without grinding .
however , it is difficult to dissolve the smelts . therefore , the solution was to increase the proportion of sodium carbonate in the flux so that the smelts dissolve quickly and simply .
the experimental conditions of proportion of boracic acid-sodium carbonate flux , melting temperature and time , sample content , sample grain size and so on were optimized .
the results indicate that the detection limit of the method is 0.0003 % -0.0051 % and the precision ( rsd , n = 11 ) is 0.88 % -4.78 % .
the consistent results were verified by standard materials and the national standard method .
for this method , the samples were decomposed sufficiently . the grain size accommodation limit of the samples easily meets the requirement for quick inspection
based on the analysis of the natural gas occurrence features , component features , types and sources , this article shows the contribution of source rock of the carboniferous and jiamuhe formation of the lower permian to the gas reservoir and points out that future research should be strengthened to the source rock geology , geochemistry characteristics , and gas-generating potential .
to natural gas , there is not only dissolved gas in oil pools but also pure gas in gas pools .
the dissolved gases distribute in both the permian system and the mesozoic , and were derived from the fengcheng formation source rocks . they migrate and accumulate with crude oil and are oil-type gases .
the natural gases in gas pools distribute chiefly in the jiamuhe formation and the upper wuerhe formation which overlays the jiamuhe formation in wuba area , were derived from the highly mature jiamuhe formation source rock and migrated , accumulated in gaseous phase , and they are coal type gas .
the jiamuhe formation source rocks have an important controling role in gas pools in the jiamuhe formation and the strata overlying the jiamuhe formation .
the carboniferous source rocks have contribution to coal-type gas in depth .
there is certain natural gas exploration potential in the structural downdip part of the discovered gas pools and deeper parts which will be the next main exploration target
taking the ln2tⅰreservoir in lunnan oilfield as an example , the effects of water flushing on physical property of early rock sample are counted .
fluid and core from the oilfield are used in a simulation experiment of water flushing at high temperature and high pressure .
statistics and simulation experiment indicate that the high-capacity channel have not formed after water flushing , and the presence of areal and vertical heterogeneity in ti layer is probably the main cause of water breakthrough advance .
small amount of water injection rate during production has slight effect on reservoir physical property .
bound water saturation increased slightly and interstitial oil saturation reduced slightly after multiple water flushing , and the rangeability increased with the decrease of permeability .
core permeability changed little within 100 times pore volume washing , decreased slightly between 100 and 450 times , and almost remained unchangeableness more than 450 times .
water flushing can alter the core wettability toward water-wet

traditionally , fluid substitutions are often conducted on log data for calculating reservoir elastic properties with different pore fluids .
their corresponding seismic responses are computed by seismic forward modeling for direct gas reservoir identification .
the workflow provides us with the information about reservoir and seismic but just at the well .
for real reservoirs , the reservoir parameters such as porosity , clay content , and thickness vary with location .
so the information from traditional fluid substitution just at the well is limited .
by assuming a rock physics model linking the elastic properties to porosity and mineralogy , we conducted seismic forward modeling and avo attributes computation on a three-layer earth model with varying porosity , clay content , and formation thickness .
then we analyzed the relations between avo attributes at wet reservoirs and those at the same but gas reservoirs .
their linear relations make it possible to directly conduct fluid substitution on seismic avo attributes .
finally , we applied these linear relations for fluid substitution on seismic data and identified gas reservoirs by the cross-plot between the avo attributes from seismic data and those from seismic data after direct fluid substitution

the bayan obo giant ree-nb-fe deposit is the one genetically related to igneous carbonatic rock .
rare earths , niobium and iron were enriched from carbonatitic magma intrusion stage , altered country rock stage ( fenite ) , to late-stage hydrothermal stage .
therefore , the bayan obo deposit is not a unitary type of deposit , but a mixed deposit containing ree-nb-fe carbonatite-type mineralization , ree-nb-fe replacement alteration , and hydrothermal effect . the deposit of such kind is very rare , and thus can be called bayan obo-type deposit .
based on age data published , the formation time of larges-scale carbonatite of the bayan obo deposit and the peak period of associated rare earth mineralization are around 1.3 or 1.4 ga .
the caledonian tectonic thermal event had wide and extensive effect on this area , resulting in the development of large folding , thrust faulting and ductile shear , and extensive fluid metasomatism and regional hydrothermal activities . isotopic composition systems of some rare earth minerals were relocated , suggested by disagreement of sm-nd ages and th-pb ages .
alkaline rock is not only present at basement complex of this area but at subsequent 1.3 or 1.4 ga carbonatite of bayan obo group .
current data available at least shows a genetic relation between alkaline complex and carbonatite .
the basement complex in this area indicates that there existed an arc mass at the bayan obo area at 2.0 ga , and during the paleoproterozoic time ( 2.0 ~ 1.9 ga ) the bayan obo area experienced a complete orogenic process from passive continental margin to accretion collision of active continental margin
microscope , cathodoluminescence microscope , ordinary physical properties , grain size analysis , mercury injection method , scanning electron microscope and x-ray analysis were often used for comprehensively studying the diagenesis of the fuyu reservoir in songfangtun oilfield .
the reservoir rocks were mainly of fine-very fine feldspathic litharenite with high content of mudstone fragments .
reservoir space was mainly of reduced original intergranular pore .
the reservoir had the characteristics of low porosity and permeability , changeable displacement pressures , pore-throat radius and maximum mercury saturation , and low mercury withdrawal efficiency .
compaction and cementation induced damage to the reservoirs , while the dissolution enhanced the porosity .
the high geothermal gradient , fine size of framework grains and abundant mudstone fragments were the key factors greatly reducing the porosity of sediments under the compaction .
calcite cement was the next factor for reducing the porosity .
the dissolution of feldspar and intermediate basic volcanic rock fragments played an important and constructive role of reservoirs .
the minor amount of carbonate cements , which is formed during early diagenesis , can resist against compaction and preserve pores .
microquartz rim , grain-rimming chlorite formed during early diagenesis can preserve the porosity through the inhibition of cementation by quartz overgrowths

in addition , the test on different weight of &quot; decaying averaging method &quot; showed that the correction skill was best when weight was round about 0.1 for 850 hpa temperature and 2 m temperature and round about 0.06 for 500 hpa geopotential height
the qingdong sag is a cenozoic basin in the east of the jiyang basin , a part of the bohai bay basin , and is bounded by the tan-lu fault to the east .
it is a faulted basin during the paleogene and a depression basin during the neogene to the quaternary .
nearly ew , nw and nne-striking fault systems occur in the sag .
the former is newly-formed normal fault while the later two are reactivated basement faults .
the sag was under ns extension during the paleogene . the nw-striking faults suffered oblique extension and showed sinistral normal faulting .
this kind of basement faults had intense activity during the early paleogene , i. e . kongdian to lower sha-4 period and therefore controlled a nw-trending sedimentary pattern .
the new nearly ew-striking normal faults predominated during the late paleogene since the upper sha-4 period , leading to the formation of a nearly ew-trending sedimentary pattern .
the nw-striking basement faults show three methods of reactivity such as direct activity , formation of new en echelon faults and direct activity plus propagating into ew-striking normal faults .
the nww-striking basement faults are dominated by the direct activity whereas the large nw-striking basement faults exhibit the formation of new en echelon faults , suggesting that the reactivity methods are affected by the orientation of the basement faults

in this paper , the characteristics of wind field over offshore fujian and its formation associated with typhoon meranti ( 1010 ) is investigated to provide some clues for prediction with data from automatic meteorological observation , buoy weather observation , ncep reanalysis data , radar retrieved data and etc .
results show that , during the period , because of the channelization , flow distributing and blocking effect of central mountain range of taiwan island , strong wind mainly occurs in the east of typhoon and the north of offshore region , and the gale appear in the middle of costal area at first , at most of the impacting period , wind evolution displays one apex structure .
in particular , for micro-typhoon , such as meranti ( 1010 ) which developed in taiwan strait when it approached monitoring stations and enhance abruptly , it indicate that nowcasting and short-time monitoring is very important for wind fine forecasting .
data verifications display that ncep reanalysis data can display the gale over the sea and radar retrieved wind verifying with observation can also provide some useful reference .
buoy observation can monitor early wind evolution .
however , its wind speed is not always stronger than the nearest automatic meteorological observation , which may be closer to the typhoon position .
therefore , the application of buoy observation still needs to be further analyzed

based on exact calculation of tidal currents , the present contribution models the suspended sediment transport patterns in the hangzhou bay .
the model results reproduce the distribution characteristics of suspended sediment concentration ( ssc ) in the hangzhou bay with three high ssc zones and two low ssc zones , the flow and sediment transport patterns associated with landward transport in the north and seaward transport in the south , and the sediment accretion in most parts of the hangzhou bay .

we present a 3d prestack time migration scheme and workflow that can image land seismic data without datum static corrections .
the scheme mimics the influences of the near-surface and overlay on wave propagation using two equivalent velocities .
as a result , it is not necessary for wave path to be vertical incidence in the near-surface , as in conventional static corrections . this leads to the proposed scheme which can handle the more complex surface cases , such as the exposure of high velocity in the near-surface .
the proposed scheme can update the two equivalent velocities with respect to the flats and consistency of the events .
a synthetic 3d dataset and a field 3d dataset without datum static corrections are used to demonstrate the scheme and the workflow

different structures and functional groups in organic matter have different carbon isotopic compositions .
this kind of difference can be predicted by carbon isotopic thermodynamic factor ( β-factor ) of organic matter .
in the simulation experiments , the carbon isotopic composition of co2 is relatively heavy , which is related to that the thermodynamic carbon isotopic factor ( β13c ) of carboxyl is relatively large in kerogen .
in hydrous experiments , part of methylene finally changes into co2 by way of cleavage , hydrogen transfer and reaction with water . because the β13c of methylene is relatively small , correspondingly the carbon isotopic composition of the increased co2 is relatively light in hydrous experiments , so the carbon isotopic composition of co2 in the two series of hydrous experiments is slightly lighter than that in anhydrous experiments .
in the three series of experiments , the carbon isotopic composition of methane is relatively heavy in the low temperature phase ( ≤ 300 ℃ ) , which may be related to that the carbon isotopic composition of methane precursor is heavier in this early-mature stage , such as methoxy group .
the thermodynamic carbon isotopic factor of methoxy is relatively heavy , which causes that the isotopic composition of methane is relatively heavy in the low evolution stage .
extreme rainfall may easily lead to mass landslide disasters , which , however , cannot be predicted as a monomer .
, no rainfall , 25 mm , 50 mm and 75 mm respectively using gis spatial modeling and analysis and analyzed their errors .
the results show that : ( 1 ) landslide disasters in loess hilly areas are related to topography , mechanical properties of rock bodies and earth .
headward erosion of rainfall and surface water is macro background of developing landslide disasters .
( 2 ) rainfalls in loess hilly areas such as linyou county are prone to inducing shallow strata loess landslide , represented by loess mudflow and shallow landslides .
( 3 ) for the same amount of rainfall , different units in slope areas have different response mechanisms , and high risk zones , middle risk zones and low risk zones are generated in areas with significant differences .
under the four different rainfall conditions of no rainfall , 25 mm , 50 mm and 75 mm , watershed area in the middle , tiantang town in the north , and zhangba township are high risk zones which are prone to generating rainfall landslide disasters .
( 4 ) in high risk zones with rainfall induced disasters , the situation threatens safety of residents of nearby villages and small towns , and hence monitoring , warning and corresponding preventive measures should be taken .

the cenozoic tectonic evolution of the laizhouwan sag were systematically analyzed using currently-available seismic and drilling data , distribution features , tectonic restoration , deposition and subsidence history , and etc .
the sequence and tectonic analyses reveal that in the cenozoic , there were at least two phases of tectonic stress field changes , which played vital role in the formation and evolution of the layzhouwan sag .
one occurred during sha3 period ( about 40ma ) and the other between paleogene and neogene ( about 20ma ) . the former was coupled with another tectonic event , the tan-lu fault &apos;s slip reversal from left lateral to right lateral , and it implies that both of them may have some geodynamical relationship .
analysis of type of the basin indicates that the laizhouwan sag is not a typical right-lateral strike-slip pull-apart basin , but a rifted basin controlled mainly by the extensional regime affected by the strike-slip . it is likely that the basin was affected by the left-lateral strike-slip before sha3 period , and then was reformed into rifted and depression basin under the influence of right-lateral strike-slip .
integrated study shows that evolution of the laizhouwan sag in cenozoic can be divided into four stages : rifted stage ( from kongdian period to sha3 period ) , rifting-depression stage ( from sha 2 period to dongying period ) , post-rift depression stage ( from dong 1 period to guantao period ) , and neotectonism-related post-rift depression stage ( from minghuazhen period to now )

in order to test applicability of the mikeshe model in the chaohe watershed , and to examine impacts of the changes on decadal runoff of the chaohe river over the past 45 years , the mikeshe model was applied to the research in the chaohe watershed . after calibrating the model with a multi-site calibration procedure , hydrological impacts of changes in land use and precipitation were disentangled by running scenario simulations .
results show that the model was generally good at simulating the average runoff and the dynamic variation of the runoff in the watershed , although the modeling performance was less satisfactory in the dage station than in the xiahui and daiying stations , with nash-sutchliffe coefficient for the three stations being 0.56 and 0.49,0.65 and 0.69 , and 0.57 and 0.68 for the calibration and validation periods , respectively .
compared with the reference period ( 1963 to 1979 ) , the period from 1980 to 1989 witnessed a sharp decrease , ca 22 mm , in annual runoff in the watershed , to which changes in land use and precipitation contributed almost equally , accounting for 59 % and 41 % , respectively .
the period from 1990 to 1999 did not see much change in annual runoff as compared with the reference period , which was owing to the hydrological impact of the change in precipitation being offset by that of the change in land use during this period .
and the period from 2000 to 2008 had its annual runoff cut by 35 mm , of which 80 % was attributed to the change in precipitation and 20 % to that in land use

dawanqi oilfield is a light oil-based oilfield .
the concentration of biomarkers and the abundance of neutral nitrogenous compounds are comparatively low that make it difficult to reveal the crude oil migration characteristics .
research shows that , commonly , there is a kind of compounds with high thermal stability in oils of dawanqi oilfield . they are the diamondoids , including diamondoid and bidiamondoid hydrocarbons .
chromatographic analysis indicates the compounds with different structure have great discrepancy in their chromatographic retention behavior .
according to the similarity of chromatographic retention behavior and stratum chromatographic effect in principle , the oil fractionation effects of dawanqi oilfield during migration have been studied by using the ratios of diamondoids with different chemical structure .
the results show that the migration parameters based on diamondoids have obvious distribution law . in general , the migration parameters of diamondoids increase as the buried depth gets shallower . the results indicate that crude oil migrates vertically .
the migration parameters of diamondoids are low in areas near deep faults .
the migration parameters of diamondoid increase from south to north far from those deep faults in the plane .
all these show that the main migration direction of the crude oil in dawanqi oilfield is from south to north

based on the ncep / ncar reanalysis data and the 160-station observational data , a comparison for 12eawm indices and their relations to winter temperature and precipitation over eastern china have been performed in this paper .
the results indicate that most of the eawm indices share the same variations year-to-year , but there are some differences between them at the same time , which suggest that the focuses of each index in capturing the integrity or partial features are different .
it was found that the intensity of the eawm system reduced obviously during the last 60years , especially in the latest 30years with a trend of 0.25σ / 10aaveraging from the 10eawm indices . all of the 12eawm indices showed intense interannual variabilities and interdecadal variations during the last six decades .
among them , the siberian high index can explain 53.3 % variance in winter temperature pc1 , and the east asian meridional wind index derived from the middle-high troposphere can explain 50.4 % variance in winter precipitation pc1 .
the relationships between each eawm index and winter temperature and precipitation over eastern china during el ni  o status and la ni  a status are not consistent completely . so , the different reference significances of each eawm index in el ni  o status or la ni  a status should be considered carefully when used in winter climate monitoring

based on the structural analysis principle that different boundary conditions in the same stress field build different nature faults , it is commonly considered that fault subsidence of the hailar basin is controlled by the sse-nnw-trending extensional stress field , forming nne-and nee-trending faults , with nne-trending faults displaying distinct strike-slip deformation .
during rifting-subsidence transformation phase of the hailar basin , the extensional stress field orientation of faulting and subsidence was adjusted to near ew direction , forming near ns-trending faults , and twisted deformation of nne- , nee-and sn-trending faults .
the basin returned again at the end of yimin formation deposition and the near ew-trending compressional stress field resulted in the sinistrial deformation of the basin and intensive inversion of nne-and nee-trending faults .
based on the superimposion relatioinship between faulting and deformation , the hailar basis can be divided into four faulting systems : early extensional faulting , interim tensile shearing faulting , early extensional and interim tensile shearing faulting , and early extensional and interim tensile shearing and late reversal faulting .
the early extension and interim tensile reverse faults of rift and subsidence layers resulted in fault sheltered traps .
early extensional faulting formed a complicated anticline traps by cutting through the uplifts within depression and slopes , and complicated fault block traps by assembling with interim tensile shearing faults .
the early extension , interim tensile shearing and late reversal faults appear as &quot; comb-like &quot; composite , forming typical fault block traps in the rift-depression structure layer .
based on the coupling relation between fault activity period and accumulation period , and analysis results of typical oil and gas reservoirs , it is concluded that the early extension faults and early extension plus interim tensile shearing faults constituted sheltering faults at a critical moment of accumulation , with the sealing hydrocarbon column height generally less than the traps amplitude , and early extension and interim tensile shearing and late reversal faults were adjusted to faults .
on the basis of trap styles , and roles of faults in reservoir-forming and transporting system , the modes of fault controlling reservoir in the hailar basin can be divided into 2 groups and 4 styles . two groups include primary and secondary reservoirs .
the primary reservoirs consists of three styles : the first is the model in which oil and gas migrate laterally in hydrocarbon kitchen margin and is sheltered by reverse faults , with the early extension and interim tensile shearing fault system as leading reservoir-controlling faults ;
the second is &quot; in the box &quot; reservoir-forming model in which oil and gas primarily migrate within hydrocarbon kitchen and is sheltered by faults ;
and the third is the dispersive-type reservoir model in which oil and gas in hydrocarbon kitchen of the depression migrates laterally .
reservoir-controlling faults of both models are early extensional faults .
secondary reservoirs are an &quot; umbrella-shaped &quot; reservoir-forming model , in which oil and gas migrates vertically along faults , with the early extension and interim tensile shearing and late reversal fault system as reservoir-controlling faults

this method determines secondary positioning coordinates of sensors by scanning grids , fitting curved surface and solving the extreme value of the curved surface .
the application to real data shows that this new method has the advantages of high efficiency and high accuracy

the lead-zinc ore deposit in west baoshan , hunan province , belongs to a medium-low temperature hydrothermal filling-metasomatic deposit , of which the grade of silver is 156.6 μg / g through chemical analysis .
the study of the process mineralogy of silver in this ore zone is presented in this paper .
by means of ore microscopy , chemical analysis , scanning electron microscope ( sem ) and electron microprobe analysis ( epma ) , the main types of silver , host occurrence of ag and technological features were studied .
silver is mainly enriched in the upper seam rather than the lower seam , and is richer in the nw-sw seam than that in the ne-se seam , based on the chemical analysis of ore samples , of which the ore types mainly include dolomite-type , sandstone-type , limestone-type and breccias-type , with silver content of 595.78 μg / g , 247.97 μg / g , 195.8 μg / g and 169.73 μg / g , respectively .
the highest content of silver was found in dolomite-type ores and the lowest in breccias-type .

lower jurassic zhenzhuchong formation and the second number of upper triassic xujiahe formation are two main gas production strata of jiulongshan gas field , however , no conclusion has yet to be reached about gas source for the both strata .
therefore , this contribution makes a detailed analysis about the gas component , carbon isotopic composition , source rocks and reservoir bitumen biomarkers , to clear the gas sources of zhenzhuchong formation and the second number of xujiahe formation .
there are 2 offsets of high quality hydrocarbon sources : the shales of shallow xujiahe formation ( third number ) , limestone of deep maokou formation and mudstone of lower cambrian .
in general , gas is dry , and gases from both the zhenzhuchong formation and the third number of xujiahe formation have similar characteristics , while gases from the second number of xujiahe formation have combined characteristics of both shallow and deep gases .
δ13c2 value is averaged at-26.73 ‰ for the gas from zhenzhuchong formation , which is similar to the xujiahe formation coal source of periphery wenxingchang and zhongba gas fields .
the δ13c2 value is from-29.5 ‰ to-30.49 ‰ for the gas from the second number of xujiahe formation , which demonstrates characteristics of both shallow coal-derived and deep oil-derived gas .
zhenzhuchong formation has high tricyclic terpane value and rearrangement sterane / steranes value , which is the same as xujiahe formation . c27 / c29 value is from 0.93 to 1.00 , like shape &quot; v &quot; .
the second number of xujiahe formation has similar low tricyclic terpane values and rearrangement sterane / steranes to that in maokou formation .
therefore , it is concluded that gases in the zhenzhuchong formation is sourced from the third number of xujiahe formation , while gases in the second number of xujiahe formation are mainly derived from both the third number of xujiahe formation and deep maokou formation
laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry ( la-icp-ms ) is suited to analyze the abundances and spatial distributions of trace elements in sulfide .
however , the spread use of the technology on micro area analysis has been hampered by the different characteristics of sulfides from silicates and oxides and the lack of sulfide reference material , especially pge-bearing reference material .
in this study , a pge-bearing sulfide ( srmd-1 ) is synthesized by remelted nickel sulfide fire assay button in an evacuated quartz tube .
the examination by bse imaging revealed that the nickel button srmd-1 was completely of monosulfide composition .
homogeneity testing by la-icp-ms shows that the rsds of elements , such as s , ni , cr , co , cu , pb , sb , cd , bi , are less than 10 % .
the data suggest the homogeneous distribution of these elements inside srmd-1 , but elements mn , zn , sn , tl are not as homogeneous with relatively larger rsds .
elements ag , au and pt are homogeneous inside srmd-1 , but rsds of other noble metal elements are relatively larger according to low element content , instrument fluctuations or mass spectrometry interference .
the homogeneity of the nickel button will be improved by increasing the content for the noble metal elements and lowering the quenching temperature for the molten samples .
during the analysis of the nickel sulfide fire assay button , the spectral interferences in light pges ( ru , rh and pd ) by argides is serious , and must be corrected , while the interferences to os , ir , pt and au can be ignored .
compared to the button which is not remelted , the homogeneity of the elements improved significantly .
according to the work documented here , it is possible to synthesized pge-bearing sulfide reference material for la-icp-ms by remelted nickel sulfide fire assay button
there are reliable chemical analysis methods for determining high , low and trace amounts of antimony in gold-antimony ore and antimony ore .
however , the volumetric method for low content antimony measurements has a low analysis efficiency and involves a complex process .
atomic fluorescence spectrometry has a strong memory effect for high and low content antimony samples , resulting in poor analytical precision and accuracy .
by using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry ( icp-aes ) , the disadvantages of atomic fluorescence spectrometry , atomic absorption spectrometry and the volumetric method can be overcome .
in this article , a description of the method for adding hydrofluoric-nitric-perchloric acid to dissolve samples , and using sulfuric acid as the latent solvent is given . the antimony in 20 % hydrochloric acid was determined by icp-aes with a wavelength of 217.5 nm .
the detection limit is 30 μg / g and precision is less than 5 % .
the results of the national standard materials agree well with certified values .
the results for actual samples with different antimony content are consistent with the results by cerium sulfate volumetry and atomic fluorescence spectrometry .
this method is reliable for samples with antimony contents of 0.05 % -5 %

the lakeshore sediment and its magnetic characteristics may suggest hydrodynamic conditions , sedimentary environment and paleoclimate .
in this paper , we choose the samples of different lithology from the cores obtained at the bosten lakeside for magnetic studies .
combined with the data of x-ray diffraction , grain size and toc content , the depositional process was inferred .
the magnetic minerals of the samples are dominated by ferrimagnetic minerals with low coercivity and rather coarse particle size . magnetite is the main magnetic mineral in the sediment . in the samples of different lithology , magnetic susceptibility values show distinct differences .
xrd analysis reveals that the sediment mainly consists of sands and silts of quartz and feldspar showing a coarsening upwards sequence in general with some opposite fluctuations .
organic matter of the middle part varies apparently , suggesting the shifting of the sedimentary environment .
with the changes in magnetic properties in the samples of different lithology , and based on the response of grain size , organic matter and sediments color to sedimentary dynamics , we can tentatively infer that the lake has experienced a complicated history of sediment dynamic changes , reflected by alternating lakeshore facies , limnic facies and shallow lake facies
in northern dongying sag , the reservoir formation and distribution of upper submember of the fourth member in the shahejie formation is the study focus in recent years . it is an important oil-bearing sequence .
the solid-fluid interaction mechanism and its influence on physical properties of reservoirs could be studied by the observation of polarizing and fluorescence microscope and the analyses of sem on thin sections in combination with regional tectonic evolution and thermal history of organic matters .
conclusions are drawn as follows . there are seven active fluid episodes in the variation of diagenetic environment , namely , alkaline , acidic , alkaline , acidic , alkaline , acidic and alternating alkaline and acidic setting , respectively .
the interaction of acidic fluid and solid presents significant dissolution of carbonate minerals and feldspar , and quartz overgrowth to enhance the reservoirs ;
while the interaction of alkaline fluid and solid is characterized by quartz dissolution , feldspar overgrowth and the precipitation of ferrocalcite , ankerite and anhydrite , which largely infill pores and destroy the reservoirs .
there are two hydrocarbon expulsion episodes , namely , the deposition period from the second member of shahejie formation to dongying formation , and the latest one of guantao formation . these two events are in correspondence with the development of two secondary pore zones

typhoon morakot ( 0908 ) caused severe damage .
in order to explore the underlying reasons , the phenomenon that the intensity of the typhoon always remained around 960h pa and did not reduce when it passed over the island of taiwan is studied from both observational and numerical simulation results , by using the ncep / ncar1 ° * 1 ° data and wrf numerical model .
the observational analysis shows that the no reduction of typhoon morakot &apos;s intensity was closely related to the interaction between morakot and goni ( 0907 ) , which was in its southwest direction , and some physical quantities from typhoon goni were continuously transported into morakot , such as the inputting of water vapor were mainly from 950 to 850 hpa , but rarely above 600h pa .
the transmission of vertical velocity existed in the whole layer , extending from 1000h pa to 300h pa . the positive vorticity ( negative divergence ) was transferred at the lower levels , and the negative vorticity ( positive divergence ) at the upper levels .
using the wrf numerical model for each control and sensitivity experiment in which typhoon goni was filtered , the results show that vorticity , moisture flux , divergence , and other physical quantities from typhoon goni were transported and involved in typhoon morakot , and thus they gave positive contribution to the maintenance and no reduction of typhoon morakot intensity when it passed over the island of taiwan

several comprehensive methods have been applied , such as sliding average method , mann-kendall test method , hurst index method , gm ( 1,1 ) model and so on .
the main results of this research are as follows : the average precipitation of beijing city is about 588.1mm in the past 60 years ;
the percent of precipitation concentrated in summer is about 72.5 % in beijing city , the month with the most precipitation is july and the least is december ;
among the extreme precipitation index , one-day maximum precipitation , extreme rainfall days , extreme rainfall ratio and the longest continuous days without precipitation present diminishing trend with different degrees , while the days without precipitation present increasing trend with a ratio of 2d / 10a ;

the average temperature , average highest temperature and average lowest temperature of beijing have risen with different degrees over the years , the amplitude of the average highest temperature is the least while the increasing trend of average lowest temperature is most significant with an increasing ratio of about 0.5 ℃ / 10a ;
using the ncep / ncar reanalysis data during 1980-2004 , some forcing factors , such as la-tent heat release from condensation and underlaying surface thermal differecence , are defined and their impacts on the south-to-north cross-equatorial flow are studied with diagnosis analysis and numerical simulation .
main conclusions are shown as follows : the cold australia land always corresponds to strong australian high or frequent cold air activities , which is favorable for the formation of strong cross-equa-torial flow ;
the cold underlaying surface to the south of the channel is often accompanied by weak walker circulation , which is also helpful for the establishment of strong cross-equatorial flow ;
the warm indo-china peninsula and cold south china sea , as well as the strong heat source near the philippines , all can be associated with strong convergence zone in north hemisphere , which is advantageous for the formation of strong cross-equatorial flow .
the features of forcing factors and circulation factors corre- sponding to weak south-to-north cross-equatorial flow are opposite to the above ones
neoproterozoic and early ordovician granite intruded into amphibolite has been identified in the kesang rongdong region , southwestern tianshan mts .
zircons in the gneissic muscovite granite have hydrothermal rims , which replaced their igneous mantles with detrital cores .
shrimp analysis on these igneous zircon mantles ( without mixture of hydrothermal rim and detrital core ) gives an average u-pb age of 752.3 ± 5.1ma ( mswd = 0.95 ) . this age represents the magma intrusion episode .
hydrothermal zircon rim formed in the early ordovician granite in some cases though most zircons do not show continuous hydrothermal rim .
one euhedral zircon crystal consists of detrital core and hydrothermal rim , the latter has much younger u-pb age of 419.5 ± 5.7ma comparing with most other measurements .
the average u-pb age , corresponding to igneous zircon rims ( 481.1 ± 4.4ma , mswd = 0.88 ) , represents a magma intrusion episode in the kesang rongdong region .
thus , the gneissic muscovite granite and amphibolite have been intruded by the early ordovician granite .
afterwards , these different granites have undergone metamorphism as recorded by the hydrothermal zircon , which replaced igneous zircons

the poyi layered intrusion , which is mainly composed of ultramafic rocks , develops cumulate texture and rhythmic layering .
the magma differentiated thoroughly and formed many types of rocks , which range from dunite to quartz diorite .
in the ultramafic rocks , all olivine and most orthopyroxene occur as cumulate phase , while small part of orthopyroxene , most clinopyroxene , brown hornblende and biotite are intercumulate .
in the mafic rocks , all olivine and orthopyroxene are cumulate phase , while all brown hornblende , biotite and quartz are intercumulate . but the clinopyroxene and plagioclase may be cumulate or intercumulate .
the ultramafic rocks are tholeiitic series and the mafic ones are calc-alkalic .
xenoliths occurred in the intrusion , geochemistry of trace elements and emⅱ evolutionary trend of nd-sr isotopic composition , fully demonstrate that the contamination increased as magma evolving .
at the same time , contamination promoted magmatic differentiation and brought about the transformation of geochemical series .
geochemistry of platinum group and thiophile elements , as well as isotopic composition of sulfur , show that sulfur mainly came from mantle-derived magma and sulfide formed during magmatic stage .
the sulfide segregation began in the late stage of the crystallization of peridotites and went on as the magma evolving .
the fo value of olivine and feo content of whole-rock show that the primary magma was picritic and formed by partial melting of axis plume .
the main rocks of magmatic source should be garnet-pyroxenolite .
the other permian magmatite in northeastern tarim plate , which derived from asthenospheric or depleted continental lithospheric mantle , also should be part of the tarim large igneous province ( lip )

complex landscape matrix consisted of forest land and cropland accounted for 67.98 % of the total landscape in 2000 and 54.46 % in 2011 in the study area . built-up land area increased from 33213.91 hm2 to 68380.79hm2 , and amount of increased area between 2000 and 2004 was more than that between 2004 and 2011 .
the area of forest land decreased insignificantly . the shift of water and unused land area was insignificant .
patch number in the class and landscape level decreased obviously , which showed that decreasing landscape fragmentation , enhancing connectivity of forest landscape , and reducing connectivity of farmland was taking place during the study interval .
landscape spatial pattern had a significant aggregation in the expected maximum distance ( 40 km ) .
the critical thresholds discrepancy of clustered , random , and dispersed distribution between different landscape types in different years were relatively evident ;
the spatial aggregation levels of water and unused land were significantly higher than those of farmland , woodland , grassland , and built-up land ;
there were the largest characteristic scale of heterogeneous spatial distribution of aggregated distribution , random distribution , and dispersed distribution for cropland and grassland .
the effect of landscape pattern characteristic study via coupling landscape index analysis and multi-distance spatial cluster analysis is better than that of using single landscape index analysis .
the simulation of ca-markov model could basically reflect the future landscape changes .

in order to analyze the effects of electrical resistivity in heavy metal contaminated sites , we established the resistivity model of typical contaminated sites and simulate the dc resistivity method with wenner arrays using the finite element method .
the simulation results showed that the electrical method was influenced by the contamination concentration and the location of pollution . the more serious the degree of pollution was , the more obvious the low resistivity anomaly , thus the easier the identification of the contaminated area ;
otherwise , if there was light pollution , wenner array could not get obvious low resistivity anomalies , so it would be hard to judge the contaminated area .
our simulation results also showed that the closer the contaminated areas were to the surface , the more easily the pollution was detected and the low resistivity anomalies shown in the apparent resistivity diagram were influenced by the layered medium .
the actual field survey results using resistivity method also show that the resistivity method can correctly detect the area with serious pollution

tectonic movement and climatic change are two fundamental factors for the formation of river terraces .
however no consistent point of view was reached at present to end the argument between climatic change and tectonic movement which was considered to be the dominant factor controlling the formation of river terraces .
by focusing on the river terraces flowing along the yellow river around the ordos plateau , this paper attempts to figure out the controlling factor to the formation of the yellow river terraces through chronological comparison among which of river terraces formation , uplift of qinghai-tibet plateau and transition period from glacial to interglacial .
the comparison indicates a fact that most of terraces along the present yellow river channel around the ordos plateau were formed synchronously with tectonic movements around the qinghai-tibet plateau . however , no clear relations can be found between the transitional time span from glacial to interglacial period and formation of the yellow river terraces .
such a comparison supports the idea that the driving force for the formation of river terraces around the ordos plateau was tectonic movements instead of climatic change

in the geo-location method based on common points in multiple aerial images , the computational efficiency of the simultaneous least square estimate used to reckon the corrections of aerial camera parameters and ground point coordinates degrades rapidly with the increase of the number of common points .
to solve this problem , a novel algorithm is presented to separately estimate the corrections of camera parameters and ground point coordinates by considering the feature that the coefficient matrices of the corrections of camera parameters and ground point coordinates are independent .
it is theoretically based on the separate least square estimation , and calculates the corrections of camera parameters and ground point coordinates in every iteration step alternately .
in the iteration procedure , the coefficient matrices are parted to decrease their dimension numbers . such partition improves the efficiency of correction computation .
simulation results show that the separate algorithm has higher computational efficiency than the present simultaneous algorithm , without degrading the precision of the corrections

these sand bodies are the favorable reservoirs , they are the beneficial targets for oil exploration evaluation
can earthquakes be predicted ? how should people overcome the difficulties encountered in the study of earthquake prediction ?
this issue can take inspiration from the experiences of weather forecast .
although weather forecasting took a period of about half a century to advance from empirical to numerical forecast , it has achieved significant success .
a consensus has been reached among the chinese seismological community that earthquake prediction must also develop from empirical forecasting to physical prediction .
however , it is seldom mentioned that physical prediction is characterized by quantitatively numerical predictions based on physical laws .
this article discusses five key components for numerical earthquake prediction and their current status . we conclude that numerical earthquake prediction should now be put on the planning agenda and its roadmap designed , seismic stations should be deployed and observations made according to the needs of numerical prediction , and theoretical research should be carried out
by comparisons of the petroleum gevlogic conditions between dongpu sag and dongying sag in bohai bay basin , the reasons for the differences in hydrocarbon resources and 3d spatial distribution of these two sags are presented .
the study shows that dongpu sag is not as superior as dongying sag in shallow reservoir-forming condition . it has the possibility of small-scale hydrocarbon accumulation or reservoir-forming , but the control factors are extremely complex .
the main reasons are as follows : the abundance and quality of source rocks in dongpu sag are poor and difficult for preservation , with a large proportion of natural gas in its generated hydrocarbons ;
a great quantity of hydrocarbon generation and formed traps appear in late dongying formation , hence there exist a large quantity of oil and gas dispersion and loss ;
because of little hydrocarbon generation and weak fault activity in the neogene , the oil and gas migration toward the shallow strata is short of power and channel , and unfavorable for shallow reservoir-forming in this sag

it was shown that the results from both methods were almost consistent .
the recharge zone method is simpler , and it can avoid the uncertainty of calculated results caused by the uncertainty of hydrogeological parameters , which validates its application to the precise calculation of the allowable withdrawal of bedrock fissure water
geochemistry and geochronogy of the monzogranites from kuruktag in xinjiang were studied in this paper .

mapping high spatial-temporal resolution evapotranspiration ( et ) over large areas is important for water resources planning , precision irrigation and monitoring water use efficiency . recently accurate estimation of et is becoming available via a number of methods using surface meteorological and sounding observations , which are used to represent only local processes , meet insuperably difficulty to mapping et in large areas due to land surface heterogeneity and the dynamic nature of the heat transfer processes .
nevertheless , most of the existing techniques of et estimation from satellite remote sensing are not satisfactory , because satellite monitoring of et has not been feasible at high pixel resolution . therefore , using traditional measurements and high resolution image data to generate high spatial-temporal resolution et is becoming an important research direction .
in this paper , the complementary relationship model ( cr ) was employed together with meteorological data to estimate actual et , and the results were validated by lysimeter observation .
furthermore , cr model was combined with high resolution image , ikonos data , to estimate instantaneous field scale et and they also were transferred into daily et . the cumulative evapotranspiration ( et ) of winter wheat during the reproductive phase from march to june of 2011 was 469.12 mm , essentially corresponding to the annual precipitation in the beijing area .
the most high accuracy of estimated et by cr model is also on may ( r 2 = 0.863 , rmse = 0.103 mm ) .
the transferred daily et by self-preservation of evaporative fraction ( ef ) method were consistent with lysimeter measurements for all four months ( r 2 = 0.937 , rmse = 0.668 mm ) .
the estimated daily et by the ef method was consistent with lysimeter measurement for each of the four months . the ikonos image-based instantaneous and daily et over vegetation-covered area increased with increment of leaf area index ( lai ) and decreased with increment of albedo .
it was proved in this study that cr model can be used to estimate precision field scale et with meteorological data and high resolution remote sensing data together in a region with limited ground data availability , e .

this study investigated temporal and spatial variations of the reflectivity and precipitation structure within 300 km radius of typhoon center by using the reflectivity data taken from the doppler radars located in zhejiang province .
three typhoons making landfall along the southeastern coast of zhejiang province in china have been selected to examine the changes of the precipitation distribution from 6 h before landfall to 7 h after landfall .
the three-dimensional wind fields are retrieved from the wenzhou doppler radar data using the 4d-var wind retrieval technology .
the 3d structure of the mesoscale convective system producing the most severe heavy rainfall at yunyan and changchan is analyzed with the single-doppler radar retrieved wind and radar reflectivity observed by the wenzhou doppler radar .
the results show that the stronger the typhoon intensity is , the bigger the reflectivity of the middle and low levels is , and the more severe the mesoscale convective system and the precipitation rate are .
the axisymmetric component of typhoon echo ( rainfall ) , represented by the radial distribution of the azimuthal mean reflectivity , reveals that echo ( rainfall ) spreads outward from the typhoon eyewall before landfallling .
the mean echo ( rainfall rate ) in the inner-core region increases abruptly , accompanied with the rapid contraction of the precipitation areas toward typhoon center when typhoons are approaching the coast . the mean rainfall rate in the typhoon eyewall will intensify after landfall .
the single-doppler radar retrieved wind fields indicate that , at 1 h after typhoon landfalling , with the enhanced convergent ( divergent ) wind fields in the low ( upper ) levels , the tilted upward movement in the mesoscale convective system is enhanced and the precipitation rate is increased obviously .
the typhoon intensity is proportional to the increases of the precipitation rate .
the stronger the typhoon intensity is , the bigger the vertical winds shear value is . the area of the maximum vertical wind shear value is corresponding to that of the most severe heavy rainfall .

the caledonian granites in south china are not so well developed as yanshanian granites , and the qinjia granite in southwest guangxi is one of the famous caledonian granites .
the qinjia granitoid pluton , located at the southwestern edge of yangtze plate , is a typical early paleozoic pluton .
based on previous research result of geochronology , the authors performed a lot of detailed work on geochemistry .
the sio2 content of rocks is in the range of 65.94 % ~ 72.23 % , the total alkalis content ( k2o + na2o ) is in the range of 6.27 % ~ 9.11 % , and the k2o content of most rocks is higher than na2o content . the a / cnk values are 1.02 ~ 1.24 , assigned to species of weakly peralumious .
the rocks have low and remarkably varying ree , ranging from 17.18 * 10-6 to 128.33 * 10-6 , and their distribution patterns show lree enrichment with gentle rightly-oblique deviation , relatively flat hree and significant negative eu anomaly .

the results indcate the oil of fuyu oillayer in changchunling and chaoyanggou as i type , while in the shuangcheng depression as ii type .
from the ratios between tricyclic terpenes / pentacyclic triterpenoid and tm / ts , it is supported that the oil in changchunling is similar with in chaoyanggou , and obviously different from in the shuangcheng depreesion .
combined with the maturity of source rock , generate-discharge ability and plane distribution , it is illustrated that the oil in changchunling anticline mainly originates from the source rock of the k1qn1 in sanzhao depression characterized by the oil generated in top and storaged in the bottom .
the reason of the poor oil came from the south part is the low maturity and the poor expulsion ability of hydrocarbon .
the paleogeography reinstated by the way of mudstone compaction indicates that the wells of fall exploring in the high-order position presently located in the bottom of the paleostructure where is not the main direction of oil and gas migration .
the main controlling factors for oil and gas accumulations in changchunling anticline include the distribution of hydrocarbon-generating center , the tectonic-paleogeography background on accumulation period , the sandbody nearly south-north orientation and faults

based on seismic forward-modeling of attenuation medium , we estimate the relative absorption coefficient , one of the absorption parameters , by s transform , according to the relationship between the amplitude in the frequencies which is symmetric about the peak frequency .
in the light of the relationship between the absorption coefficient and quality factor q , we derive what the relative absorption coefficient have to do with offset .
and then , a more reliable relative absorption coefficient is calculated , which is independent of offset through multi-channel fitting method .
finally , a model is established to estimate the relative absorption coefficient from the synthesis cmp gathers in attenuation medium based on non-zero offset one-way wave equation . we also apply this method to pre-stack seismic data in angle domain .
relative absorption coefficient is estimated from near , middle and far angle gathers and fitted . in this way , the high relative absorption coefficient indicating cap rock and reservoir filled with water on post-stack seismic data are eliminated on pre-stack seismic data .
compared with that coming from single angle seismic data , relative absorption coefficient obtained from pre-stack seismic data in angle domain can suppress the illusive high relative absorption coefficient caused by strong reflection of cap rock . as a result , more reliable oil and gas indication , and a more accurate reservoir prediction are achieved .
both synthesis data and real data examples show the effectiveness of the method

meanwhile , by combining the vlbi phase delay data , the accuracy of the short-arc orbit determination is improved to ~ 10 m
the ore bodies of the jiama ( gyama ) copper polymetallic deposit are mainly hosted in skarn . garnet skarn is the main skarn type , and it is therefore significant to study the mineralogical characteristics and genesis of the garnet .
based on previous studies , the authors used electron microprobe to analyze the garnets collected from different depths of drill holes at the mine center and the edge of the jiama ( gyama ) deposit , with a detailed comparative study of mineralogical characteristics .

based on meteorological observational data , ncep reanalysis data and cloud pictures of fy2c , the occurring and developing mechanism of a mcc event on nov. 9,2010 was analyzed .
the results show that the mcc occurred in a ground warm inverted trough .
the moving eastward of a low trough at 500 hpa , the development and moving eastward of a low vortex at 850 hpa and the weak cold front caused by the moving southward of the cold air on the boundary layer provided favorable environmental conditions for the formation of mcc.the mcc occurred in the convective unstable area where the low energy tongue in the middle troposphere overlapped with the high energy tongue in the lower troposphere .
upper-level divergence , low level convergence and the coupling of the strong vorticity column and divergence column was the main dynamical mechanism of the mcc development and maintenance .
during the developing and mature stage of the mcc , the atmosphere was unstable layer which strengthened with the rainfall and appeared the feature of wet neutral vertical motion in the middle and lower troposphere levels .
in the mature stage , the wind direction in the mcc center with strong wind shear shifted clockwise with the height and the mcc had the structural characteristics of supercell storm

this is helpful for current data evaluation , data processing and analysis , and earthquake prediction .
based on the pan-chen model ( pan ; chen and yang ) , evertson theory and theory of elasticity , both volume strain and area strain models were set up under area stress .
in addition , we have derived similar formulas for calculating transform coefficient between volume strain and area strain in observation hole , empty hole and non-porous rock condition , respectively .
the difference only lies in the factor k ( ratio of volume strain gauge on the steel cylinder wall or non-porous rock surface strain to area strain of the empty hole rock ) .
the theoretical formula derived from evertson model is close to the case of empty hole rock with the rock elastic modulus ranged from 4 * 10 10 pa to 8 * 10 10 pa .
both results may be regarded as a simplified pan-chen model .
for non-porous rock , the factor k may be predicted by taking rock modulus as 1 * 10 10 pa .

this paper collects and analyses the 145 paleozoic volcanoes in north xinjiang , including 32 volcanoes on the edge of junggar basin , which are clustered mainly in boluokenu mountain , bogeda mountain , tuoli gold belt and kerameili mountain .
they can be divided into 3 classes , such as calderas , volcanic domes and volcano vents ( volcano necks ) .
there are also 85 volcanoes in junggar basin , which are primarily in the ke-bai fractured zone of the northwestern margin of junggar basin , 3 depressions ( dongdaohaizi depression , dishuiquan depression , sannan depression and wucaiwan depression ) and 7 uplifts ( baijiahai uplift , beisantai uplift , dibei uplift , dinan uplift , sangequan uplift , shixi uplift and xiayan uplift ) .
the volcanoes inside the basin are principally controlled by hercynian fault systems , along ne and near ew trending faults and most developed in the interjunctions of the faults .
the modification by late-stage weathering and leaching made the volcanoes difficult to identify . remaining volcanic landforms , changing trends of the volcanic lithofacies and the typical volcanic rock , such as the crypto-explosive breccia , are the typical marks of the late paleozoic volcanoes in the field ;
and the concealed volcanic edifices are identified by the techniques of seismic identification , such as seismic slicing , analysis of the attribute and tectonic trend plane .
the ages of the volcanic rocks are focused on from 340ma to 320ma and from 300ma to 295ma , corresponding to the subducting periods of west junggar and east junggar .
from early carboniferous to late carboniferous , the volcanic activities in junggar basin and its adjacent areas show a variation trend from undersea to continental , from deep water to shallow water and from continental margin to intracontinental

prestack depth migration methods include two categories . one is kirchhoff method based on high-frequency approximate solution of wave equation , the other is differential method based on the finite difference solution or mixed-domain solution of wave equation .
gaussian beam method is between them and is used for wave propagation chracterization and imaging .
the problem of gaussian beam method is that too many approximations are introduced when characterizing the wave propagation in the ray-centered coordinates .
in addition to high-frequency approximation , the amplitudes of wave field whose plane is perpendicular to any point of the ray path is merely derived from the amplitude gauss attenuation of that point , which is too simple to characterize the complex wave phenomena .
therefore , we derived the one-way wave equation in ray-centered coordinates and used the equation to extrapolate wave field in ray beam to accurately characterize local wave field .
the method preserves the flexibility of ray method and the accuracy of wave equation method to describe the wave field within certain ray beams .
compared with simple ray theory and complex wave equation theory , the method makes a compromise between the flexibility and accuracy . it can be used to complex subsurface structure imaging and tomography velocity estimation more conveniently .
numerical examples demonstrate the correctness of the method

time-lapse seismic reservoir monitoring technology is one of the most important technologies that can determine the distribution of residual oil directly .
spatial difference correction for time-lapse seismic data was studied in this paper , aiming at solving the difficulties in the demand and application of time-lapse seismic reservoir monitoring technique in china .
spatial position difference for the same reflection point in different migrated sections caused by the differences in geometry and acquisition orientation results in unreasonable time-lapse seismic data difference , which increases the difficulty and risk of time-lapse seismic interpretation processing parameters .
the optimal shifts in x , y and time directions are calculated by 3d cross-correlation between local data volumes from reference data and monitor data . and then the spatial position difference correction can be conducted for monitor seismic data .
the comparison and analysis of real time-lapse seismic data indicate that time-lapse seismic spatial difference correction is effective in decreasing 3d nonlinear spatial difference of purposeless repeated acquisition time-lapse seismic data

the obtained results show that the distribution of the turbulence flux was uniform due to the different land uses . the contribution of grass for the turbulence flux was largest in whole year .
for the varying atmospheric stability stratification , the contribution of the turbulence flux was different around 200 m surrounding the station . upwind of the tower were high flux contribution and high quality of the turbulence flux .
under the unstable and neutral stratification condition , the data quality was higher than it under stable surface layer at night .
the low quality of the turbulence flux was under the stable stratification .

using the monthly circulation index data of national climate center from 1951 to 2010 , the relationship among the intensity , area and central intensity indexes of the northern hemisphere polar vortex are analyzed .
and the temporal variation features of the polar vortex intensity in winter were discussed through the intensity index .
the results show that the polar vortex intensity index has a good correction with the area index and the central intensity index , which can represent the change of the stratospheric polar vortex well in winter .
the polar vortex mainly has a decadal oscillation period of 13 years and an interannual oscillation period of 5 years after the 1990s .
the changes of temperature , precipitation and the general circulation in winter are discussed by the observation data and monthly mean reanalysis data from ncep / ncar.in relative strong years of polar vortex , the temperatures in north china and east china , especially in northeast china are higher than that of relative weak years of polar vortex .
and the precipitation is above normal in southern china region especially in mid-and lower-reaches of the yangtze river and south china , but below normal in the north china .
besides , it can be found that the 500 hpa potential height is higher in the mid-and high-latitudes and lower in the high latitude , while the polar vortex is relative strong . the circulation implies that the east asian winter monsoon and east asian trough is weaker correspondingly .
under this situation , the cold air gathered around the polar and warm air flows to inland region , which causes the higher temperature in east china and northeast china , and more precipitation in the southern china and the yangtze river regions

the pressure difference between initial coal seam pressure and critical desorption pressure was neglected in previous material balance methods . therefore , a modified method has been presented in this paper .
in the deri-vation , the initial gas content is expressed as a langmuir &apos;s equation about the critical desorption pressure , rather than the initial coal seam pressure .
finally , a linear material balance equation of the pseudo average reservoir pressure ( p / z * ) versus cumulative gas production ( gp ) is obtained , whose intercept on horizontal axis yields the initial gas reserves , and intercept on vertical axis gives the pseudo critical desorption pressure , instead of the pseudo initial reservoir pressure .
by using this method to evaluate a simulated reservoir , its reserves can be ob-tained with an error less than 0.35 % , which indicates the method is reliable when the langmuir &apos;s volume and langmuir &apos;s pressure , average reservoir pressure , initial cleat porosity are accurate

the huangsha tungsten deposit is an important large quartz-vein type w-polymetallic deposit in southern jiangxi province .
based on detailed petrographic observations and using the means of fluid inclusion assemblage ( fia ) , we carried out microthermometric and raman microspectroscopic studies of fluid inclusions in early wolframite-quartz veins and late sulfide- ( wolframite ) -quartz veins of the main ore-forming stage of huangsha tungsten deposit .
the fluid inclusions are mainly aqueous inclusions and carbon-aqueous inclusions in wolframite-quartz veins and only aqueous inclusions in sulfide- ( wolframite ) -quartz veins .
experimental results show that the aqueous inclusions decrease in homogenization temperature from the early veins to the late veins at constant salinity .
raman microspectroscopic studies of the fluid inclusions show that , the main component of aqueous inclusions in wolframite-quartz veins and sulfide- ( wolframite ) -quartz veins is h 2 o , whereas those in wolframite-quartz veins are major h 2 o , minor co2 , and rare ch 4 and n2 .
the characteristics of fluid inclusions in the huangsha tungsten deposit indicate that the fluid immiscibility caused by co2 escaping possibly led to metals precipitation in the wolframite-quartz veins and the fluid mixing led to metals precipitation in the wolframite-quartz veins

the santanghu basin is a small intermountain basin located in northeastern xinjiang , nw china . the middle permian comprises the wulapo , jingjingzigou , lucaogou and hongyanchi formations from bottom to top . the lucaogou formation was formed of interbeded sedimentary rocks such as dolostone , limestone , black mudstone , shale and detrital rock in lacustrine environment .
two kinds of dolostones were found in this basin .
one was named silt-micrite dolostone which contains 70 percent of clay-sized dolomite , 30 percent of silt-sized dolomite .
the dolomite exhibit weak ordering with degree of 0.48 . morphologically , the dolomite was divided into micro-rhombohedra , xenomorphic crystal , microsphere , and microtubule types under the sem.part of the micro-rhombohedra dolomite was ferric dolomite .
the other kind of dolostone was named analcime-sanidine dolostone which was composed of fine grained analcime with the granularity of 0.08 ~ 0.35  mm , micrite potash feldspar ( almost sanidine ) , micrite dolomite , ankerite , and few coarse crystalline dolomite . this kind of dolomite also showed weak ordering with degree of 0.58 .
compared with the dolomites in silt-micrite dolostone , the dolomites in analcime-sanidine dolostone which were almost subhedral rhombohedras under the sem were characterized as high iron and manganese .
the similarities between these two dolostones were that they were poor ordering dolomites , abundant in strontium , and lacking of the evidence in replacement during the buried period .
although these two dolostones were deposited in the similar shallow and semi-deep lake anoxic reduction environment , their differences in composition , trace elements and stable isotopes indicated that they had great diversity in their genesis . the silt-micrite dolostone revealed the features of primary precipitation . the microbe was likely to play a formative role in the precipitation of the microspheroidal and microtubular dolomites .
moreover , the micro-rhombohedrala and xenomorphic dolomites were directly precipitated from lake water . contrastly , the dolomites in analcime-sanidine dolostone were precipitated by the hydrothermal exhalative processes of the sublacustrine hotsprings

based on the concept of fault motion coordination ration ( fcr ) , the paper discussed the effect of the starting point on the result of fcr calculation and proposed a calculation method of fcr using sliding windows and an evaluating index of dispersion .
the case study of the lijiang site indicates that the fcr of lijiang site distributed more widely and discretely before the m7.0 lijiang earthquake than after it , which reflected strain accumulation and caused poor movement coordination during the seismogenic period .
after the earthquake the fault is in a free activity state , and the accumulated strain energy is released , and 3-component movements are consistent to each other .
at present , fcr dispersion of lijiang is low and fault strain accumulation is also at a low level

the annual gravity variation in the same measuring position , which is for seismic monitoring by repeated measurement , is about more than a few tens 1 * 10-8m · s-2 .
however , since the topography of the measuring position is varying from point to point , the gravity anomaly gained through gridding will be influenced directly .
so we calculated the topographic effects with different scales and depth of field sources by the hexahedral model in this paper , and with this as the basis , we analyzed the gravity observation data of the eastern margin of qinghai-tibetan plateau , and removed the influence of the terrain by the method of potential field continuation .
the results showed that this method was efficient in improving the quality of the gravity data , which was more helpful in cognizing the space characteristics of gravity anomaly and also the gravity field variation by repeated measurements
under the intense rainfall infiltration , the air in the shallow slope is likely to be confined , and the pore air pressure in air-confining condition increases constantly as the infiltration of rainfall .
the physical meaning of the air-closing pressure is illustrated through the force analysis of the wetting front . compared with the classical green-ampt infiltration model , the simplified infiltration model considering the air pressure is used to study the effects of air pressure on the infiltration rate and the moving wetting front .
then the infiltration process and stability analysis of a large area of shallow slope with bedrock beneath is studied through the simplified infiltration model .
the results show that the air pressure in the air-confining condition reduces the infiltration rate and the safety factor remarkably , which could also reveal the reason that why some areas had frequent landslides after the rainfall .
so considering air pressure for landslide forecasting is greatly significant

the results show that , the heavy rainfall mainly happened in the development state of the cold vortex , and there were small scale , suddenness features , which with typical meso β-γ scale characteristics .
high temperature , high relative humidity , geopotential unstable layer and high vapor tongue stretched toward the northwest in the low level and the dry air incursion in the middle level provide the extraordinary favorable environment condition for the development of the convective system .
the configuration of the two upper level jets intensifys the divergence above the convective area , coupling with the ahead of the lower level jets on the south side of convergence zone , which strengthens the rising stream of the storm .
sountherly lower level jet of exit region on the south side of upper level jet enhances the inflow intensity of storm which provide the plenty of vapor for the convective systems .
the dry air incursion of middle level of western rainstorm make the cold dry air to be rapidly trans port the convective strom occurrence area , which leads to thermo-inversion layer .
before the convective system happened , the thermo-inversion layer of middle and lower levels the dry layer of upper level is separated , which accumulates the unstable energy of the storm . the low level northwest horizon wind strengthens the convergence of surface stream field , which is the key factor of initial convective systems

provenance analysis is an effective and important approach to tracing the origin of sedimentary basin fills and reconstructing the orogenic history of basin-bounding uplifts .
in this paper , the authors used palaeocurrents , gravel components , detrital compositions and u-pb ages of detrital zircons to systematically analyze the provenance of the lower cretaceous basin in the north qilian mountain-beishan area and , furthermore , discussed the basin-mountain framework in the early cretaceous period .
in beishan area , the on such a basis , two provenances were identified .
the south provenances were composed of metamorphic basement and neoproterozoic magmatic rocks from the central qilian terrance , the north qilian volcanic arc ( o ) , magmatic rocks originated from the collision ( s2-3-d ) and the early mesozoic igneous rocks in the south qilian mountain .
however , the north provenances were composed of paleoproterozoic magmatic rocks and deep metamorphic rocks from the dunhuang-kuruktag terrance , located in the northeast of tarim block , and the granites were produced by the collision and post-collision in the northwest of north china in paleozoic-early mesozoic period .
besides , the evolution of the source suggests that the north source provided sediments for the corridor in the initial period , and then both provenances existed in the early period . in the middle stage , the south provenance became the main source , while the northwest and south sources supplied sediments together finally .
in a word , the eastern north qilian mountain-beishan area seems to be a unified interior basin

the water vapor mainly comes from the bay of bengal , the circulation configuration of sustained high-level divergence and low-level convergence is in favor of plenty of low-level water vapor convergence , ascent and condensation motion , which can provide an advantageous condition for the conversion of precipitation .
influenced on moving eastward and development of the upper-level trough , dry intrusion can be mainly observed in two patterns , in the vertical direction , the dry air from the mid-upper troposphere can be extended into the lower troposphere ; in the horizontal direction , the dry air can intrude from west to east .
the stronger descending motion exists to the west of 103 ° e , which could be recognized as the carrier of the dry intrusion .
the analysis of moisture potential vorticity and slantwise vorticity theory shows that , when the dry air along with high potential vorticity from mid-upper troposphere intrude into lower troposphere , the slantwise vorticity and low-level vertical vorticity develops due to the conservation of moisture potential vorticity , which facilitates ascend motion brings water vapor upward . when cold air and warm air interacts , the rainstorm event happens
to study influence of diffusion coefficient , relaxation rates , pore component ratio and pore width on nmr t2 distributions , a complex rock-pore system is simplified to an equivalent dual porosity medium in a mathematical physics model with bloch &apos;s equation .
adi-fdtd and sirt methods are used in numerical simulations of nmr transversal response and decomposition of nmr t2 spectrum , respectively .
it shows that transversal magnetization vector decay rate is proportional to diffusion coefficient and micro porosity , inversely proportional to pore width and nearly irrelevant to surface relaxation rate .
nmr t2 spectrum hardly reflects pore components and structure as diffusion coefficient is small and pore width is large .
special attentions should be paid to influence of diffusion coefficient and pore-size as evaluating pore structure by nmr
the rock pressure sensitivity was one of the major factors inducing poor effect in low permeability reservoirs , to study the effect of reservoir physical property on the pressure sensitivity in low permeability reservoirs , the effects of permeability , heterogeneity and fractures on the rock pressure sensitivity were studied through laboratory simulation .
the results show that the lower the permeability is , the stronger the sensitivity is , and permeability loss is mainly at the initial stage of an effective pressure increase .
the permeability of heterogeneous rock sample is between single layer with high or low permeability , its test result of pressure sensitivity is stronger than that of a parallel rock sample .
the permeability loss in fractured reservoir is more greater than that in matrix reservoir , its loss degree is related to the permeability of meddle-level matrix in fractured cores .
the lower the permeability of matrix is , the bigger the loss of permeability in fractured cores is , conversely , the loss is smaller

the element al is determined frequently in rare earth ore since al is a common impurity element in this ore .
at present , the inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometric ( icp-aes ) method , which has certain requirements of the al blank and the matrix concentration , is used to determine the content of al in ore with a matrix matching calibration .
because al has complicated patterns in many kinds of rare earth ores , it is difficult to dissolve al completely into solution for determination by a routine acid-leaching method .
in this paper , a new method is described , whereby the sample is digested by alkali fusion and the filtrate acidulated before the content al in rare earth ore is determined by icp-aes.the effect of spectrum interferences of rees and th on the al was studied . the detection limit was reduced effectively by eliminating the interferences of coexisting elements .
the matrix correction mode was undertaken to eliminate the salt influence .
the determination limit of the method was from 0.021 mg / g to 0.035 mg / g and the determination content range was from 0.50 % to 8.00 % . the rsd was less than 7.1 % .
the result of the samples with the presented method is consistent with the volumetric method .

geoscientists all over the world paid a broad attention to the lithosphere of north china craton ( ncc ) , which was destructed since phanerozoic .
a three dimensional p-wave velocity model obtained from seismic tomography was used to construct an initial 3d density model . then , we got high resolution three dimensional density distributions of the lithosphere in ncc by gravity inversion using bouguer gravity anomaly .
in order to improve the inversion speed , algebraic reconstruction technique ( art ) was applied for it can avoid the large and sparse matrix inversion of observation equations by using row iterative technique .
the results indicate as follows : density distributions of lithosphere beneath north china craton are inhomogeneous both in horizontal direction and vertical direction . and the density distribution underground is coherent with surfical tectonic .
in ncc crust the density anomaly is low , while it is strongly high at 80 ~ 120 km depth .
the ordos block crust exhibit a low density distribution , and high density anomaly with big amplitude exists at 80 ~ 120 km .
the high density distribution is conjoint with the high density anomalies of qinling and yinshan orogen in the south and north , respectively .
that may indicate that ordos block underwent the deep dynamic process from orogen in the south and north .
high density anomaly is visible beneath the mid taihang mountain orogen and eastern basin region at 80 ~ 120 km depth .
at the same depth , remarkable high density anomalies exist beneath eastern of ncc with strong lateral heterogeneous in ns direction .
it indicates that the upper mantles are inhomogeneous in ns direction beneath this region

the distribution of hail-rich zone is zonal along high altitude and mountains and the hail events occur more frequently in the north than in the west and east .
the average annual hail days are 20.8 days in tibet , and the biggest center locates at naqv .
the seasonal change of hail days is obvious in tibet , and hail often occurs from march to october . most hails happen from june to september . tibet is a typical summer-hail district .
there is little hail happens in the morning or at night , instead , it happens mainly at 12 to 20 o &apos;clock .
there is a positive correlation among the hail , altitude and thunderstorm .
the happening of hail is closely connected with the synoptic system , such as vortex , shear line , westerly trough and west pacific subtropical high
lithochemical compositions , trace elements and rare earth elements of the marble in shuanghe were analyzed in this study .
the positions of metamorphic zircons and metamorphic complex zircon were determined using cl zircon image .
the dating results are listed as follows : 1 ) the older core &quot; inherited zircon &quot; in the metamorphic complex zircon were measured at 32 points with ages ranging from 2357 ma to 342 ma , 15 of which belong to proterozoic era with ages range from 2357 ma to 572 ma , 17 to the paleozoic from 524 ma to 342 ma .
2 ) 8 points had been tested in the metamorphic zircons , and ages of 5 points fall with the scope of 249 ma to 234 ma corresponding to the uhp metamorphic time .
the ages of 228 ~ 221 ma represent retrograde time .
existence of a number of magmatic detrital zircons , i. e. inherite zircons , indicates that protolith of the shuanghe marble rock is likely the argillaceous limestone with an age of later than the paleozoic era
with the daily snow depth data from 51 meteorological stations in the northern region of xinjiang over the period of 1961-2008 , we have mainly analyzed the spatial distribution and periodic characteristics of mean and annual maximum snow depth and the number of days with daily snowfall greater than 10 cm from november to march .
the results show that : 1 ) the spatial distribution of the maximum snow depth and the number of days with daily snowfall greater than 10 cm show significant differences among different regions . in geography , heavy snow areas are mostly distributed along the mountain range , such as the area of north aletai , fuyun and qinghe , bogda-peak in medium tianshan mountain , tacheng basin and yili river valley in the west tianshan mountain ;
2 ) the annual mean and annual maximum days with daily snowfall greater than 10 cm in heavy snow areas are 20-25 days and 65-75 days respectively ;
3 ) wavelet transform results show that the annual maximum snow depth in heavy snow areas has distinct periodic characteristics . in particular , there exists the first period of 7a and the second period of 11a in aletai and tacheng basin , which belong to the same warm area .
the yili river valley , which belongs to the cold front area , has vibration periods of 11 and 7 years or so ;
4 ) the first and second periods in tacheng basin are similar to those in aletai region , but yili river valley has the reverse periods . this is largely caused by climate background , circulation situation and the influence system . also , it is somewhat related to geography position and the topography .
northern part in sichuan basin was controlled by multistage actions of surrounding orogenic-zones which result in many superpositions and recombinations of structure and multiple favorable sources- reservoir-cap combinations in vertical direction .
the migration transporting systems in the research area was classified into four kinds : fault form , reservoir form , fracture form , and unconformity plane form .
according to oil-gas accumulation characteristic of northwest and northeast area of sichuan basin , controlling factors of oil-gas accumulation are following as : ( 1 ) the paleo-liftes which controlled the distribution of oil and gas ;
( 2 ) communication of insidious fault in vertical direction which provided a favorable condition for oil-gas migration and accumulation ; ( 3 ) reservoir developments which controlled the distribution of oil and gas in the foreland basin ; ( 4 ) the structural overlay action in later period which accelerated the hydrocarbon reservoir ′ s evolution
the drilling performance curve , well logs and seismic data are analyzed using sequence stratigraphy theory , and five sequence interfaces of triassic in tabei-tazhong area , tarim basin , which belong to type-i sequence interfaces except si-2 and si-3 belonging to type-ii.based on these interfaces , the triassic can be divided into four class-3 sequences , hence the sequence stratigraphic framework of the triassic in this area is developed and its sedimentary characteristics are analyzed .
it is suggested that the triassic belongs to a set of strata deposited in convergent period in inland downwarping basin with three types of sedimentary systems characterized by varied facies distributions of braided fluvial delta , coastal lake , semi-deep lake , deep lake along the basinal margin toward the basinal interior .
the composite analysis indicates that the studied area develops four types of reservoir sands , which could form multiple traps by separated or matching development , such as updip pinch-out , lenticular sand and underwater distributary channel . they are the ideal targets for lithologic reservoirs of the triassic in this area

the first leading mode shows similar characteristics during the onset of scs summer monsoon ( scssm ) before and after the decadal shift .
the spatial distribution of precipitation in early and late onset years shows a pattern of alternatively dry and wet from the equator to the north , and an anomalous cyclonic circulation is located north of the scs at 850hpa .
corresponding large-scale circulation shows that relative to the first mode the scssm trough is southward in late onset years before the shift and it is northward in early onset years after the shift .

controlling factors on hydrocarbon accumulation in the north sea basin were studied in this paper based on previous research data .
it reveals that there is a double-layer structure in the trifurcate rift grabens .
the lower layer is a faulting structure formed by the movement of stretch rifting by the end of late jurassic , while the upper is a depressed structure formed by the thermal subsidence after early cretaceous .
most of the main faults occurs in the strata older than cretaceous .
the plays of hydrocarbon accumulation are mesozoic fault-anticline sandstone controlled by the lower rift structure .
therefore , the rift stretching during late jurassic-early cretaceous is the main controlling factor to hydrocarbon accumulation

jiuzhai huanglong airport is one of the three airports in the tibetan plateau .
prediction of surface gale is very important for the taking off and landing of airplane .
the surface winds , especially surface gale , were investigated by using the data obtained by the automatic weather station from 2004 to 2007 , as well as the wrf model .
the results show that there are significant differences between mean surface wind and surface gale .
surface gale is occurred during daytime and its direction is northwest .
the favorable season for surface gale is winter rather than spring in which the maximum speed of all scale wind is occurred .
the formation of surface gale is closely related with the transition of general circulation in middle and high latitude .
the wrf model can well capture beginning and end time , magnitude and direction of surface gale .
these can be attributed to the model &apos;s good performance on the simulation of surface flux and planetary boundary layer process

comparison of the discrete formulae of the finite volume method ( fvm ) with the finite difference method ( fdm ) shows that fvm is more accurate , while it is as efficient as fdm.the weighted mean conductivity of the seawater and the sediment , which is calculated by using two volumes divided by the interface as the weightings , are set to be the conductivities of the cells on the terrain interface .
our numerical modeling shows that the weighting processes of the terrain interface can improve the accuracy of the terrain effects of csem.an oil reservoir with bathymetry variation has been simulated by our code . the modeling result demonstrates that the electric field is influenced by the terrain , however , the magnetic field is insensitive to the bathymetry
the complex surface geology and intensive tectonic activities causes the poor seismic imaging in the southern fold-thrust belt , junggar basin , challenging structural interpretation .
during the seismic interpretation of the manas structure , we first projected the outcropped strata and faults onto the seismic lines with topographic data , then defined seismic horizons with the vertical seismic profile ( vsp ) and acoustic logging data of well mana-1 and mana-002 , and finally fixed possible deep faults according to the seismic reflectance signatures .
some faults encountered during drilling can be identified by using dipmeter data .
however , as chaotic seismic reflections exist in the middle-shallow layers on seismic reflection and thrust faults slipped along the shale and mudstone in the paleogene anjihai formation , it is hard to identify the thrust faults in this structurally thickened formation by using dipmeter data .
correlation of seismic reflectance anomaly with fault depth in well mana-1 and mana-002 indicates that there is certain relationship between the thrust faults and the abnormal formation pressures tested during drilling .
a series of the thrust fault points of the wells are identified by monitoring abnormal formation pressure and the pressure gradient during drilling , and they are verified by both the pressure data of wells and the fault points identified in the adjacent wells .
the well formation pressure data tested with the modular dynamic test ( mdt ) shows that two pressure systems exist in the ziniquanzi formation and are separate by a thrust fault .
the final seismic structural interpretation demonstrates that the horgos-manas-tugulu thrust belt is composed of a series of imbricate fans
due to the existence of the overpressures and the movements of geothermal fluids , there are various unusual geological phenomena in yinggehai basin .
there exist three types of clay mineral transformations in the basin , normal transformation , faster transformation and slower transformation . the cenozoic group in yingdong slope develops hydrostatic pressure , and the clay minerals transform regularily . with the increase of buried depth and temperature , smectite transforms into illite by illite / smectite mixed layer , and smectite layer content s % in illite / smectite mixed layer decreases gradually .
overpressure &apos;s retardation also resulted in the put-off of the expulsion of h + , interlayer water and various cations , which lead the dissolution and cementation of the contiguous reservoirs to be weakened .
during neocene , a large scale of diapirism developed , and geothermal fluids richer in co2 with a temperature of 200 ℃ were active in central depression . the activity of geothermal fluids accelerated the transformation of clay minerals .

lastly , the changed trend had the difference in different season at the same region .
besides in summer , the trend of effective precipitation was disagreed with water storage , the variation tendency of water storage was consistent with effective precipitation

climate anomaly and atmospheric circulation features were analyzed over china in august 2011 .
causation of drought in southwest china ( swc ) and less tropical cyclone ( tc ) activities over the western north pacific and the south china sea ( scs ) were studied in this paper .
results showed that anomalous atmospheric circulation including positive 500 hpa geopotential height anomaly , the stronger west pacific subtropical high ( wpsh ) , weak summer monsoon , weak vapor transportation was the main reason for the swc drought .
moreover , the swc drought might be caused by the lag impact of 2010 / 2011 central pacific la nina event and warm mode of the indian ocean .
in addition , less tc activities were due to the combined impacts of multi-factors including weak convection over the scs , abnormally northward monsoon trough east of philippines , large vertical shear anomalies and the stronger wpsh

gaussian beam migration is an accurate , flexible and efficient depth migration method . it not only has the imaging accuracy approaching that of wave equation migration , but also retains many advantages of kirchhoff migration , such as flexibility , efficiency and adaptability to complex topography .
in this paper , we propose a gaussian beam migration method which can easily accommodate complex topography and relatively preserve amplitude .
by taking account of elevations , dip angles and actual trace intervals of topography , we derived an inverse wavefield extrapolation formula in terms of gaussian beams , then combined it with deconvolution imaging conditions to obtain an amplitude-preserved shot domain gaussian beam migration formula .
comparing to the original method , our method not only can decompose local plane-wave components directly from the complex topography to improve the imaging quality , but also can get migrated result which gives a direct measurement of the angle-dependent reflection coefficient .

the adjustment to the humidity filed of the &quot; 0716 tropical storm krosa &quot; in wrf model is done based on the precipitation water va- por ( pwv ) data of 124 stations from gps network in yangtz river delta region .
the results showed that after gps / pwv data adjustment , water vapor mixing ratio of shanghai baoshan station from the surface layer to the top layer of model are adjusted accordingly , and the adjustment of lower layer is greater than upper level , the adjustment of relative humidity for layers lower than 300 hpa is relative even , which are between 5 to 8 % basically ;
both the value and cover of the vapor flux center at 850 hpa are decreased after the adjustment , and the vapor transport belt at the north side of the vapor flux center is clearly moving southward .
it indicates that the water vapor transport in northern jiangsu is reduced on one hand which is bad for rainfall , on the other hand , the slightly northern moving of the water vapor transport belt in the south side of the water va- por flux center increases the slope of vapor flux gradient in shanghai and hangzhou bay , which is good for the rainfall .
in summary , using ground-based gps network data in yangtz river delta region to adjust the humidity field of wrf model would lead to better representativeness of local humidity variations and closer to the true distribution of atmospheric water vapor

based on the measured water levels at hengsha , majiagang , baozhen and yonglongsha tide gauges in 2009 , the tidal temporal and spatial variations , tidal constituents , tidal form and distortion at these gauges in the changjiang estuary were analyzed .
there exist tidal daily inequalities that mainly occur during high tide levels , and are more significant during neap tides than spring tides in march and september while are more significant during spring tides than neap tides in june and december .
the monthly maximum and minimum tidal ranges in each month at the tide gauges were given out statistically . the tidal range in the estuary varies monthly with two peaks ; the maximum tidal range reaches the maximum values in march and september , and reaches the minimum values in june and december .
the minimum tidal range reaches the maximum values in june and december , and reaches the minimum values in march and september .
the tidal range in the south branch reduced toward upstream due to the river discharge and friction .
the tidal range at yonglongsha tidal gauge is the largest among the 4 tidal gauges because the north branch has small river discharge division ratio and funnel shape bathymetry .
the tide is mainly composed by the 4 semi-diurnal tidal constituent ( m2 , s2 , n2 , k2 ) , 4 diurnal tidal constituent ( k1 , o1 , p1 , q1 ) and 3 shallow water tidal constituent ( m4 , ms4 , m6 ) .
the semi-diurnal tidal constituents m2 and s2 are the predominant ones , and the shallow water tidal constituents m4 and ms4 are apparent due to the shallow water in the estuary .
the tidal form number in the south branch is larger than 0.25 , indicating where the tide is an irregular semi-diurnal tide type there , and is smaller than 0.25 in the north branch , indicating where the tide is a regular semi-diurnal tide type .
the tidal distortion coefficients in the 4 tidal gauges are all larger than 0.1 , indicating that the tide at the tide gauges has significant distortion in the changjiang estuary , especially at yonglongsha in the north branch with tidal distortion coefficient 0.173

the altun mountains is a collisional orogenic belt strongly modified by strike-slip-faults , constituting the current northern tectonic boundary of qinghai-tibet plateau .
its uplift is remarkable part of the cenozoic uplift of qinghai-tibet plateau .
this contribution presents la-icp-ms u-pb dating results of detrital zircons , together with heavy mineral assemblages from sandstones of the xiaganchaigou formation ( e13 ) and lower segment of the xiayoushashan formation ( n12 ) from northwest qaidam basin .
our results show that there are significant indosinian and caledonian age populations in all samples .
however , significant differences in age spectrums exist between the samples from xiaganchaigou formation ages and those from xiayoushashan formation .
indosinian peaks in the age spectrums of xiaganchaigou samples are stronger than those of xiaganchaigou , whereas the caledonian peak gradually become stronger in xiayoushashan samples .
the stability coefficients of heavy mineral assemblages decrease rapidly from the xiaganchaigou formation to the xiayoushashan formation , indicating that their debris changed from a high maturity into a low maturity level and that provenance area for the xiaganchaigou formation is much farther than that of the xiayoushashan formation .
all these results imply that the altun had experienced significant uplift from early oligocene to early pliocene .
although the subduction-collision orogenes is of altun orogenic belt was completed in the early paleozoic , the currently exposed altun mountains was primarily formed by much late tectonic movement , i .
uplifting associated with strike-slip faulting in cenozoic .
this work also confirms the u-pb age spectrum of detrital zircon , associated with heavy mineral assemblage analysis , is an effective tool in research of stratum provenance and basin-mountain coupling

combined observations of sun-photometer and lidar on aerosol properties have been conducted in the intense hazy days at the beginning of april 2007 at xianghe in hebei province .
it exhibits that the atmospheric visibility reduced from 20 km to approximate 3 km .
there is a pronounced increase of aerosol optical depth ( aod ) at 3 wavelengths , particularly the aod increases form 0.31 on april 6 to 1.40 on april 10 at 380 nm , and an outstanding reduction of angstrom exponent ( alpha ) , such as alpha reduces from 1.45 on april 7 to 0.99 on april 10 .
the prominent increase of aerosol numerical density with big particles loading in the hazy days are confirmed by the relatively large changes in aod and alpha at short wavelength , the increase of coarse mode of particle volume concentration , and changes in pm10 concentration .
the vertical distributions of aerosol extinction coefficient derived from lidar show a mass of aerosols center at the height of about 3 000 m .
the changes of microphysical parameters also demonstrate the enhancement of scattering ability and decrease of absorption ability of local aerosols .
in addition , through the analysis of back-trajectory by hysplit model and ncep data , we find that mongolia may be the principal source for the big aerosols . therefore , the aerosols in the hazy days have some characteristics like sand particles

da-xiao xinganling copula large areas of intrusive rocks on the traditional understanding for the variscan .
in view of these intrusive rock , we anatomy for three typical intrusive body , and access to the latest zircon shrimp u-pb age , granodiorite age 169ma ± 2ma and 177.4ma ± 1.7ma , diorite enclaves age 179ma ± 2ma .
combined with characteristics of the main elements and microelement , it showed that they formed in early-middle jurassic-high potassium calc-alkaline series i type granite .
the three of intrusive bodies host rock and diorite enclaves have low isr ( an average of 0.704668 ) and positive ε nd ( t ) ( 1.3837 ~ 3.10652 ) value characteristics , diorite enclaves development needle cylindrical hornblende and hollow apatite , the characteristics of the intrusive rocks reflect granite genesis and mantle has the close relation .
geology , petrology and geochemistry of the detailed research shows that the intrusive bodies has the crust-mantle mixed origin , granitic magma source is mainly from the mantle of separation of a newborn crust , and its and the original ancient partial melting of crust of magma and produce from depleted mantle magmatic mutual mix formation .
through the regional dynamics analysis , this paper puts forward the continental crust growth may experience two continuous process , the first is late paleozoic post-orogenic lithosphere delamination effect , causing asthenosphere mantle uplift and mantle-derived magma mattresses effect ;
secondly , a wide range of areas lack triassic sedimentary records , explain at this time should be the northern orogenic belt strong orogenic period , this mechanism may be closely related with the mongolia-okhotsk closed orogenic , after the lithosphere plate delamination , and lead to the pre-existing new crust and the original ancient crust partial melting , thus forming granitic magma .
this may be is the important mechanism of continental crustal growth in da-xiao xinganling copula
however , the time of metamorphism so far is still poorly constrained . herein , we present laser and conventionally 40ar / 39ar analyses on fabric-forming metamorphic muscovite from a palaeoproterozoic granitoid gneiss from the sushui complex in the zhongtiao mountains .
the laser 40ar / 39ar dating returned an isochron age of 1830ma ± 20ma , and the conventionally 40ar / 39ar data yield a plateau age of 1852ma ± 11ma , which can be considered as minimum and optimal estimates of the muscovite argon closure temperature age , respectively .
furthermore , the plateau age of 1852ma ± 11ma is in excellent agreement with published u-th-pb electron microprobe monazite prominent peak age , indicating that metamorphic muscovite recorded a late palaeoproterozoic metamorphic event .
those metamorphic ages are also consistent with the metamorphic and deformation events occurred in the huai &apos;an-lüliang-hengshan-wutai-zanhuang regions of the trans-north china orogen , revealing that the eastern and western blocks of the north china craton was stitched together along the trans-north china orogen at late palaeoproterozoic , but not neoarchean

the two biotas are not identical with jinsha having 2 genus of trilobites and 5 genera of bradoriida while zunyi having 4 genera of trilobites and 2 genera of bradorrida .
zunyi and jinsha have 4 genera and 3 genera of algaes respectively and share 2 genera .
though both jinsha and zunyi located in the shallow water of yangtze platform , the difference between the two biotas implies the nonidentity of the sedimentary environment in the two places .
both of the two biotas possess the earmarks of the chengjiang biota
although the conventional geochemical methods are thought better effect methods which are used to prospect and explore in the all kinds of coverage area , it is not clear what their most effective role is in prospecting in the karst residual slope laminated coverage area pinggui area in guangxi province .
this research is mainly concerned with a study of anomaly characteristics of soil ionic conductivity on tin deposits in pinggui area in guangxi province .
the investigation to test the validity of prospecting in the approach was carried out above the known ore bodies revealed that the clear soil ionic conductivity anomalies are detected over ore bodies , and which appeared two typical summits resembling shapes which are look like a &quot; rabbit ear &quot; or &quot; hard iron teeth &quot; .
this fruitful work provided theory basis to explain soil ionic conductivity anomaly . on the basis of it , we finally carried out prospecting prediction by this method in the area and found two predictive targets where five ore bodies were found by the engineering drill
through research on mining geology and geochemical oil and gas exploration in the study area , the authors obtained some information of cretaceous hydrocarbon source rock in xiangfan-zaoyang sag : the salt wells in the eastern part of the sag show that in the middle of the upper cretaceous strata , the hydrocarbon source rock is well developed and characterized by high abundance of organic matter and moderate evolution degree , suggesting certain hydrocarbon-generating capacity .
half of the samples are related to gases of the mature oil , as evi dence by methane carbon isotope data from the surface geochemical exploration .
the seismic exploration shows that the cretaceous strata are characterized by wide distribution , great thickness and stable sedimentary environment .
the interpretation made by the authors shows that , in an area of 900 km2of seismic exploration , there exist 23 reliable or relatively reliable traps of the cretaceous strata , and the area of a trap is generally 4 ~ 16km2 , with the maximum trap area reaching 200km2 in xiangfan-zaoyang depression .
then there are 13 traps from the interpretation of seismic exploration made in the 1990 &apos;s , possessing totally 189km2 in the zaoyang depression , and with good precision .
according to the data from geological , geophysical and geochemical prospecting , the authors preliminarily evaluated petroleum geological conditions . the data obtained show that the cretaceous strata are characterized by wide distribution , great thickness , deep burial depth and high evolution degree of the source rock . it is therefore considered that cretaceous is a new target deserving further investigation
generalized basin geodynamics includes geology and geophysics of sedimentary basins .
basin geodynamics , an important academic branch and focus development field of sedimentology and / or sedimentary geology , pays attention to sedimentary basins and related basin-range systems , surface-deep process system of sedimentary basins in large scale .

recently elephant fossils have been for the first time discovered in late pleistocene in gonghe basin , qinghai province . their basic features are described .
primary identification suggests that the elephant fossils are the leg bones , ribs and teeth fossil , and a piece of calcifyed tree fossil has been collected in the same horizon . based on the characteristics of the enamel layer , ridge frequency of the tooth piece , those fossils are mammuthus primigenius .
on the basis of studies of the mammuthus primigenius fossil , combined with the regional geology and primary analyses of the sedimentological features of the strata where the elephant fossils occur , the authors think that the climate was cold and aridity during late late pleistocene in gonghe basin , qinghai province .
the evolution and migration of mammuthus were thoughtfully noted in the gonghe basin . this discovery may help us understand the migration of mammuthus , the climate change and the tectonic movement in the qinghai-tibet plateau .
the new data have been made for the biological evolution , the lake and river evolution , the climate change , the paleogeography and the paleoenvironment changes , and the stratigraphic division of the the quaternary period
the outcropped late triassic-jurassic accretionary complexes in duolong porphyry copper gold ore concentration area of northern bangong co-nujiang suture zone belong to non-smith strata which are totally disordered but partially ordered while accretionary complexes consist of bases and blocks .
the bases are late triassic-jurassic sand-muddy flysch formation and blocks consist of basalt , andesite-basalt , limestone , sandstone , silicalite , gabbro and ultrabasic rocks .
the accretionary complexes experienced strong tectonic replacement while the bases and blocks were separated by penetrative and unequal extrusion foliations or shearing foliations , suggesting accretionary complexes of a typical orogenic belt .
researches show that the accretionary complexes were derived from the lateral accretion of late triassic-jurassic southern qiangtang massif , which was related to the subduction from meso-tethys bangong co-nujiang oceanic crust to qiangtang massif . porphyry ore in duolong intruded into accretionary complexes or island arc volcanic rocks based on accretionary complexes .
duolong porphyry copper gold ore and its peripherals , such as naruo , sena , nadun etc , occurred in early cretaceous granodiorite porphyry body and its contact zone with accretionary complexes , which constrained by e-w pressure faulted structure and n-e strike-slip fault .
they have the same metallogenic environments and conditions and belong to uniform porphyry-epithermal system .
this new understanding provides new clues for understanding the geological background of the duobuza-bolong superlarge porphyry copper-gold deposit and the evolution of the bangong co-nujiang suture zone
a large amount of desert sediments were developed during the cretaceous and paleogene in sichuan basin which are valuable evidence for the wind direction and general atmospheric circulation style reconstruction .
based on measuring the foreset bedding dip directions of the large scale eolian dunes in the paleogene liujia formation in sichuan basin , palaeolatitude , paleo-orientation and general atmospheric circulation model , the palaeowind direction and general atmospheric circulation style have been reconstructed in this paper .
it is resulted that the paleogene sichuan basin was prevailing westerlies and controlled by westerly belt .
by integrating the existed results , it can be revealed that sichuan basin was controlled by north-east trade belt at first and later by westerly belt during the cretaceous which was inherited from that of the cretaceous during the paleogene and the transformation of general atmospheric circulation style was occurred at about the middle late cretaceous .
meanwhile , it can be deduced that the eastern asian monsoon sys tem had not been founded and the planetary circulation was still controlling wind system over sichuan basin at least when the studied horizon was depositing
it has been more than 30 years since the term &quot; a-type granite &quot; was defined in 1979 , more and more granites were referred to as a-type granite .
however , the term &quot; a-type granite &quot; has become more confusing than edifying because it has been applied to a broad spectrum of granitoid compositions with varying petrogenesis .
and frost et al. defined that a-type granitoids are ferroan granitoids as their distinguished fe-index ( fe * ) values in the fe * vs.
the ferroan granitoids are subdivided into 3 groups according to the aluminum saturation index and the alkalinity index that including peralkaline , metaluminous and peraluminous granitoids , and categorized into 8 subclasses further on the basis of the modified alkali-lime index .
importantly , the concept of ferroan granitoid is non-genetic , thus the evidences of trace elements or isotopes are needless essentially for its definition .
however , the major elements characteristics of the ferroan granitoids are significantly influenced by petrogenetic processes .
as a result , the ferroan granitoids can originate from distinct petrogenetic processes .
in this sense , the new classification proposed by frost et al. reveals the essence of the variety of ferroan ( a-type ) granitoids

according to physical property analysis , mercury injection , cast section sem and x-ray diffractions , the authors studied the diagenetic features of chang 6 reservoir in the zhiluo oilfield of northern shaanxi , and have reached the conclusion that chang 6 reservoir belongs to the &quot; a &quot; stage of late diagenesis .
the impact and consolidated filling have destroyed the porosity of the sandstones .
carbonate , hydrosyalite and quartz-feldspar overgrowths were the main cements that reduced the reservoir quality of the sandstones .
thin chlorite film around detrital grains prevented overgrowth of part of quartz and feldspar and precipitation of carbonate cements , thus preserving a part of primary pores .
dissolution produced secondary pores and improved the physical property .
four kinds of diagenetic facies were recognized in the study area . there exists intimate relationship between qualified reservoirs and diagenetic facies : the physical properties of secondary pore diagenetic facies are the best , followed by chlorite cementation facies . these facies constitute the favorable diagenetic facies for the reservoir development

the boluokenu metallogenic belt , suited in the north margin of the west tianshan in xingjiang , is highlighted by the well prospecting results in recent years .
in this paper , based on a comprehensive collection of former research results in petrology , the temporal-spatial distribution pattern of the magmatic rocks in this belt was studied preliminary , particularly on the characteristic of the late paleozoic magmatism which has a close association with mineralization .
the geological history of the boluokenu belt is closely related to the evolution of the north tianshan ocean . in the pre-cambrian , a unified basement was formed and the north tianshan ocean was opening .
a passive continental margin was evolved in cambrian , while the spreading of the north tianshan ocean is still underway .
the subduction of the north tianshan ocean to the yili block results a continental-arc environment developed in ordovician .
the subduction peaked at devonian to the early stage of late carboniferous and caused a series of calc-alkali magmatism .
the boluokenu belt enters into a terrestrial environment in the early permian , however , the subduction of residual ocean basin of the north tianshan ocean ceased not until to the middle permian .
an entirely intra-continental setting was developed in the later permian and the regional tectonic stress changed from compression to extension accordingly .
during the tectonic evolution , two large ore concenreation area , namely lailisigao &apos;er and axi , were developed , and two metallogenic systems were formed respectively , the skarn-porphry-vein fe , cu , mo , au , sb , pb , and zn metallogenic system which was related to the magmatic intrusive activity , and the epithermal-porphyry au , pb , zn , and cu metallogenic system that was associated with the subvolcanic hydrothermal activity

some recent studies presented two existing types of enso events : the eastern-pacific ( ep ) and central-pacific ( cp ) .
this study examined the monitoring ability of several current operational enso indices the results indicated that a single index could not distinguish the ep and cp in the historical enso events during 1950--2009 .
the nifio 3 index may only be suitable for monitoring the ep enso , while the nifio 4 index works only for the cp type .
in order to capture the occurrence of enso event and distinguish its type , we considered a new monitoring index group using nifio 3 and nifio 4 indices .
further analysis confirmed that this index group could monitor different types of historical enso events with different spatial distribution of sea surface temperature .
it had a good performance in determining the characteristics of the enso events , including peak intensity , onset , decay , mature phase , and so on
based on the visibility data at atmospheric composition monitoring station of anshan from june 2010 to may 2011 , the relationship between visibility and meteorological elements such as mass concentrations of pm10 , pm2.5 , pm1.0 , wind speed , precipitation intensity and aerosol optical depth ( aod ) were analyzed .
the results indi- cate that the monthly average visibility is in an increasing trend after august , reaches a peak in november and then drops significantly and gets the lowest value in february ; it is in a substantial increase after march , while it is in a slight decrease in summer .
the ratios of pm2 . 5 to pm10 and pm1.0 to pm10 have a negative correlation with the visi- bility , namely , the higher the visibility is , the lower two ratios are , and the decreasing trend of pm1.0 / pm10 is sig- nificant . thus , it suggests that particles affecting the visibility are mainly fine particles .
the trends of the average wind speed and visibility are basically the same , while the trend of average wind is in a negative correlation with those of pm2 . 5 / pm10 and pm1.0 / pm10 .
the average visibility decreases with the increase of precipitation intensity .
the average visibility in the days before the precipitation day and after the precipitation day is more than that in the precipitation day , and their change values and change rates increase with the increase of precipitation intensity .
it can be seen by the change of the angstrom exponent that pollutant particles impacting the visibility in anshan are more stable as a whole . it is a significant negative correlation between visibility and aod
magnetostratigraphy was studied in detail using zk12-2 borehole core from the shunyi depressuib in beijing plain . here we present the magnetostratigraphic results of zk12-2 borehole ( 719m ) located at shunyi depression .
the brunhes / matuyama boundary was found at the depth of 170m , the matuyama / gauss boundary at 706m . the gauss normal polarity chron is shown from 706 to 719m deep in the borehole . the interval from 170m to 706m is fairly correlative with the matuyama reversal in the geomagnetic polarity timescale with two normal polarity zones corresponding to . laramillo ( 200 ~ 210m ) and olduvai ( 464 ~ 520m ) subchrons , respectively .
the osl age of 10200 800a and 117800 590a was obtained from the sample at the depth of 9.7m and 40.5m. the lithologic section of the borehole zk12-2 includes the entire pleistocene and holocene series and part of pliocene series .
according to the correlation of the polarity column , and the osi. ages from the samples , and the lithologic section , our definition boundary for the n / q boundary is approximately conformable with m / g boundary . we believe that the sediments below 706m depth belong to upper pliocenc series .
the lower pleistocene series ranges from the depth of 170 ~ 706m , which was formed during 0 . 78 ~ 2 . 58ma .
considering the sedimentation rates , the boundary between middle and upper pleistocene series is the depth of 66.5m , and the boundary of the holocene and upper pleistocene series is 10m
the global wavelet power spectrum shows that the pi have possible periods of 2.57,4.83,10.65,23.25,48.56,68.30 , and 105.90 years , but only the two periods , 2.57 and 23.25 years are statistically significant at the 95 % confidence level .
it is inferred that these possible periods should be related to the natural factors of the climate change , including the non-linear forcing factors of both the inside and outside climate system , such as the 2-year qbo in the stratosphere , e1 nifio / southern oscillation ( so ) , and the solar forcing .
the solar forcing component in the pi is found equal in value to the components correlated with the inside-climate-system factors ( qbo , e1 nifio and so ) , and these two kinds of components can account for more than 90 % of the pi . the climate changes at both the centennial scales and the decadal scales are found driven by solar activity .
the precipitation index is reversely correlated with the temperature index in the north-central china , and the global warming does not obviously affect such a correlation .
the pi is found to show a special feature in the background of the global warming : the pi decomposition components of short-time periods ( less than 30 years ) fluctuate obviously more violently in the recent century than before , but a completely inverse case occurs for those of long-time periods , meanwhile the pi trends to decrease in the recent century

this result shows that the normal mapping data can properly reflect the sub-braid rate terrain structural features .
the findings give the linear mapping data , the error model of linear dem interpolation method and the propagation model of accidental errors in approximation function .
this study explains some confusing issues in the historical experiments and testifies dem optimal linear interpolation model and its outstanding features

the retrieval accuracy of cloud-base heights over land and ocean is larger than that of cloud-top heights for both cosmic and radiosonde and it is related to cloud-layer heights . cosmic and radiosonde have different retrieval advantages for cloud boundary heights of different types of clouds , and the occurrence frequency of cloud-base heights from cloudsat agrees well with that from both cosmic and radiosonde but cosmic has better consistency with cloudsat for cloud-top heights than radiosonde .
cloud boundary heights from cloudsat decrease with increasing latitudes and retrieval biases with cosmic and radiosonde are larger at low latitudes and smaller at middle and high latitudes , and the retrieval biases have different seasonal variation regularities .
in addition , the proportions of low-level clouds among the lowest layer clouds become smaller from winter to summer while the proportions of clouds whose cloud-top heights are larger than 10 km among the highest layer clouds increase gradually from winter to summer
during the tectonic history of the south china plate , continental crust gradually accreted and crustal structure became more and more complicated .
in the northern margin of the south china sea , tectonic framework was separated by regional basement faults and was characterized by a north-south zoning and west-east blocking distribution during mesozoic .
the major mesozoic sedimentary basins in the northern margin of the south china sea were located at the centeral-eastern guangdong subsiding belt and the dongsha-gaoxiong continental margin subsiding belt .
in the dongsha-gaoxiong continental margin subsiding belt , there were three mesozoic continental margin basins including the chaoshan basin , the gaoxiong basin and the bijia basin , and their total area was about 6.7 * 104 km2 .
the upper triassic and cretaceous strata were deposited with giant thickness in these basins and had good oil and gas geological conditions . the dongsha-gaoxiong continental margin subsiding belt is a favorable zone for the mesozoic petroleum exploration in the future

the jitang rock group is widely distributed in eastern tibet . previous researches divided it into two members , i .
, the upper youxi formation , composed of albite-quartz-schist , albite-twomica-schist and albite-actinolite-schist , and the lower enda formation , mainly composed of biotite-twomica-gneiss , granitic gneiss and quartz-schist , both of which belong to the pre-sinian period .
in recent years , geological mapping at a scale of 1 : 250000 divided the enda formation into two members , i .
the migmatite member and hypometamorphic member composed of schist , gneiss , granulite , amphibolite and marble .
geological mapping obtained the isotopic age as 240 ± 12ma ( zircon u-pb ) and 226.1 ± 2.4 ( ar-ar ) for the youxi formation , belonging to paleozoic . thus , the youxi formation is renamed as youxi rock group .
migmatite from the enda formation obtained zircon shrimp u-pb isotopic ages as 254 ± 8ma , 232 ± 9ma and 227 ± 1.8ma.
the previous 1 : 200000 regional survey has measured the zircon u-pb age as 253 ± 9ma and 195ma .
this may suggest that this rock member may be the variscan to yanshanian metamorphosed granitic intrusions , and should be removed from the jitang group .
the original enda formation is the real pre-sinian jitang group , composed of gneiss , mica schist , quartz schist , gneiss-based folder granulite , amphibolite rocks and marble , and is attributed to the mesoproterozoic period
the results have shown : ( 1 ) the two snowstorms were caused by upper-level trough .
there were warm and weter advection transported by stronger southwesterly flow at about 700 hpa . all atmospheric levels were near saturated . there were inversion temperatures in the middle-low level . the all level temperatures were less than 0 ℃ .
the snowstorm occurred in the front of southwest airflow in the 700-500 hpa trough and the converged region of the northeasterly and southeasterly at 850 hpa . northeasterly winds were prevailing in the surface layer .
( 2 ) there were different characters in the two snowstorms . in the november 2009 snowstorm , there was the cold air influenced firstly then the warm and wet airflows run into middle-high levels , thus lower energy was stored in low levels , forming a stable heavy snow with longer duration .
but in the february 2010 snowstorm , the warm and wet airflows inflowed firstly , then the cold air run into low levels . the vortex formed in low levels and cyclone came into being in the surface . there was convective instability in middle-low levels so that convection developed , a snowstorm with great snowfall intensity and short duration occurred .
( 3 ) in two snowstorms , the gps / met precipitable water vapor were observations all about 20 mm , which can be an indicator for snowfall amount .
the 0 ℃ isolines of the temperatures observed by densified aws were the boundary between rains and snows , which can help distinguish the precipitation forms

plentiful natural gas resource has been discovered in carboniferous volcanic rocks in ludong-wucaiwan area in junggar basin in recent years . kelameili and wucaiwan gas fields were found in this area , and carboniferous has been one of the major targets in oil and gas exploration in northern xinjiang . as a special type of reservoirs , volcanic reservoirs have attracted wide attention .
the natural gas in ludong-wucaiwan area was mainly preserved in the weathering crust of volcanic rocks at the top of carboniferous , and was mainly coal-derived gas from carboniferous humic-type source rocks .
based on the analysis of typical gas reservoirs in ludong-wucaiwan area , this paper is focused on the major controlling factors on the enrichment of natural gas in carboniferous volcanic rocks .
the results indicate that it is favorable to form reservoirs if the volcanic rocks were adjacent to source rocks and hydrocarbon-generation sags ;
the reformation by and tectonism was a key factor to improve the reservoir quality of carboniferous volcanic rocks in ludong-wucaiwan area and to develope effective reservoir space ;
the faults and the unconformity were the favorable pathways for vertical and lateral migration for oil and gas ;
the carboniferous traps and reservoirs in ludong-wucaiwan area have been affected by different degrees in different stages since the hercynian , in which the favorable source-reservoir-seal assemblages for the volcanic reservoirs were finalized in the hercynian ; while the middle yanshanian period was the key stage for natural gas accumulation

for 76 negative cg flashes , those are 3.5 μs and 1.9 μs , respectively , in 15 of which the crossing time and overshoot depth are 51 μs and 52 % , respectively .
the average half peak width of first return strokes of positive cg flashes is larger than that of negative cg flashes , with the average values being 13.6 μs and 5.6 μs .
compared with other observations both from home and abroad , the characteristics of radiation fields of return strokes of cg flashes at the daxing &apos;an mountain range are similar with those in sweden and florida of america , but different from those on the qinghai-tibet plateau
the traditional evad technology with linear hypothesis results in relatively poor-representativeness mean wind field information in the calculating for upper levels with high nonlinearity .
the magnitude of root-mean-square errors of the radial velocities at equidistance rings from the 2-order fourier series fitting can indicate the level of nonlinearity . the larger the rms , the larger the nonlinearity is .
setting the proper threshold of rms can eliminate the relatively large nonlinear rings , which makes the rings in calculation meet the linear assumption .
when the nonlinearity of winds is large , the 3 m / s threshold can avoid the bad mean wind instead of &quot; nd &quot; value .
the mean rms of all rings can reflect the representativeness of the mean wind field for the real wind field .

phase fractionation is an important form in the process of adjustment and reconstruction of reservoir for marine carbonate rock measures in our country .
nowadays , identification mark of phase fractionation is mainly limited to the differentiate ratio of c7 series compound ( methylcyclohexane , normal heptane and mehtylbenzene ) .
however , light hydrocarbon such as c5-c8 is so instable that oxidative degradation , water washing , changing of temperature and pressure conditions , hydrocarbon migration and even in the process of analysis and test will alternate its composition .
therefore , it is an inaccurate way to apply the c7 series compound as an identification sign of phase fractionation action. diamantane compounds is a kind of hydrocarbon compound with a strong anti-thermolysis and anti-biodegradation capability .
through the analysis of diamantane series of crude oil in the typical phase fractionation action area ( lunnan uplift area ) of gas washing in tarim basin , it is believed that the crude oil after gas washing is characterized by 1-methyladamantane enrichment and depletion of 1,3-dimethyladamantane , 1,4-dimethyladamantane , and 3-methyl-1-ethyladamantane .
therefore , the diamantane compounds can be used as an effective tracking mark of phase fractionation
this paper gives an overall analysis on the main achievements of the un climate conference in durban and the new trends of global climate change action .
it points out that generally speaking , the ghg emission reduction pressure in the developed countries is to some extent weakening with less financial support on climate change as the result of eu debt crisis , the enlarged production of shale gas and the fluctuating investment in new energy .
under such situation , the paper suggests the chinese government should promote the strategic adjustment in international climate change negotiation so as to improve the global negotiation mechanism and institutional arrangement of ghg emission reduction

firstly , the sinkhole formation process is stimulated with the orderly changes under load on the optical fiber . and then , the impact of the changes in sinkhole size on the sensing fiber monitoring is analyzed .
the study shows that the key factors affecting the application of the technology include the stress field distribution changes led by overlying loads and hole size change during the formation of the holes , and the difference of responding sensitivity to the stress field change among different optical cables .
the calibrated optical fiber sensing device in the study can preferably show the features of the stress field changes during the formation and evolution of the hole , which states that the optical fiber sensing device can be used in monitoring and early warning for karst collapse
the field outcrops , especially the arraying direction of gravel and various bedding structures revealed by the outcrops , seismic data , core and heavy mineral data have been fully used to analyze the four key parameters that indicate the paleo-provenance direction , which include paleocurrent directions , structural features of seismic reflection , stability coefficient , differentiation characteristics of heavy mineral assemblage and the sedimentary characteristics of jixi basin .
comprehensive studies show that the four parameters match well . there were mainly two provenances located in the west and southeast of the basin , respectively , in chengzihe formation . the west provenance was the main one , which provided sediments from the northwest , west and southwest to jixi basin , and gradually headed east while divided into two branches at hengshan uplift , entered the south and north part of the basin , respectively .
the basin still had two separate provenances , but the provenances relatively retreated , showing transgression from chengzihe to muling formation , meanwhile , the range of the lake basin became larger . the southwest provenance had a bigger impact area compared with chengzihe formation .
laboratory tests and field trials show that compared with the radar sounding system , the china-developed gps sounding system , which uses the satellite navigation wind measurement system for wind and the derived pressure from gps heights for pressure , has higher accuracy and precision .
its electrical performance , stability , and reliability meet the requirements of cimo.laboratory tests show that using the new humidity and pressure sensors in the new test conditions , the errors of accuracy are at ± 0.1 ℃ , ± 2 % , and ± 1 hpa , within the wmo requirements of conventional upper air sounding .
compared with the rs92 sounding system , the dynamic measurement performance of domestic gps radiosondes , except for the accuracy of the relative humidity , is close to the rs92 level , especially pressure , geopotential height , wind direction and wind speed that are related with the gps positioning , whose standard deviations of the consistency are almost equivalent to those of rs92 .
as for measurement accuracy , the domestic gps radiosonde is overall better than the operational l-band sounding system

an analysis is made of a severe storm occurred on 17 july 2009 in the shandong peninsula by using the v-3θ chart based on the analysis software of micaps ( 3rd edition ) .
the results show that the v-3θ chart can reveal the signs of severe storms .
the ultra-low temperature at the tropospheric top , cold air intruding into the middle-level troposphere , the caused severe convection , and abundant moisture at lower levels are the causes of the severe storm .
the v-3θ charts of the upstream stations can be used to estimate the direction and intensity of moisture transport .
the difference in the underlying surface between sea and land is also an important cause of the severe storm .
the characteristics of the v-3θ chart are useful in forecasting severe storms more than 12 hours in advance
to study the stability of the tiansan landslide in the project area of the carla hydropower station , the landslide causes , landform , and geological structure were analyzed .
the results show that landslide instability is most likely to take place under the effects of external factors and internal factors including landslide slope uplift and intensification of slope expansion .
a poor combination of planes and fissures provides boundaries for slope deformation and instability .
the fissures of the steep slope provide favorable conditions for infiltration of groundwater .
through sensitivity analysis of the external factors including rainfall , water level fluctuation , and earthquakes , it was found that a sharp increase or decrease in water level has a significant effect on the landslide stability .
short-term rainfall affects the landslide stability insignificantly , and the instability probability will increase with the increase of time duration of rainfall .
the earthquake peak affects the landslide stability .
according to the analysis , combinations of landslide conditions and loads were made , and the stability calculation and assessment were conducted . the results show that the instability probability was higher under water storage and seismic conditions , resulting from a low stability of the landslide affected by water storage and rainstorms

the ancient karst landform of the maokou formation in shunan region controls the facture-cavern system &apos;s development .
according to the thickness distribution of the maokou formation in the region , the surface erosion on weathering crust and sediment properties as well as the degree of preservation of the maokou formation , the ancient karst landforms in the maokou formation can be recognized as or divided into three 2nd grade landform units as karst platform , karst slope ( further divided into the western steep slope and northeastern gentle slope belt ) and karst basin .
then the relationship of geomorphic unit and the cave system is studied .
the results show that : water in karst platform seeps mainly vertically , weathering is strong , vertical solution fissure and cave is often filled with clay ;
the karstification is the strongest in the karst steep slope and the transition zone of karst steep slope to karst platform where pore and cave are developed , filling rate is low , fissure-cavity system develops best , and is favorable for exploration ;
the speed of water flow in karst gentle slope is slow , karst cycle is long and fissure-cavity system is easy to be filled , which does not conducive to fissure-cavity reservation ;
the erosional space in karst basin is less , and the reservoir performance is poor , which makes the area unfavorable for exploration
based on the conventional observational data and ncep 1 ° * 1 ° reanalysis data , the rainfall distribution of zonal shear line heavy rain was refinedly analyzed .
the results show that , although the location of low-level shear line is important to the distribution of heavy rain , it is not the unique decisive factor to the distribution .
the spatial structure of affecting system and the interaction between cold and warm air are essential to the heavy rain fine forecast .
with the cold air invasion from the northeast region of china and northeast wind crossing shandong province , there are two rainfall areas . one is related with the shear line , and the other is caused by frontal uplift of the ground northeast of the heavy rain area .
when a warm low is located in the northeast region of china and 850 hpa cold center entrenched in shandong province and there is a strong southwest warm air flow with shear line , the rainfall area of heavy rain is located between the shear line and the stationary front in south shandong province .
wind convergence center is often accompanied with high humidity area , and the rainfall area is usually located in the front of high humidity area and near wind convergence center

raman spectra assigned to oh are in good agreement with the ir results at 3 550 ~ 3 750 cm-1 .
dickitic tianhuang includes ordered dickite and disordered dickite .
compared with ordered dickite , the band assigned to oh3 of disordered dickite shifts to low-frequency by 8 cm-1 and the relative intensity becomes stronger . the disorder structure may relate to the high level of fe .
the ir absorption spectra of nacritic tianhuang superimposes strong peaks of dickite , indicating that ir absorption bands of dickite are stronger than that of nacrite at 3 550 ~ 3 750 cm-1 .
the main mineral composition of illitic tianhuang is 2m1 , while illite tianhuang contains a small amount of 1m.all these characters provide a theoretical basis for the scientific identification of tianhuang

in this paper , the drought actuality in the weihe river basin was investigated using drought indices based on the monthly precipitation data .
a case study was carried out to compare the consistency and difference of the calculated results of z-index and spi at xi &apos;an meteorological station .
the actuality and duration of historical drought and flood at the station at 1-month , 3-month , 6-month , 9-month , 12-month and 24-month time scales were analyzed , and the seasonal drought and flood features at the station were lucubrated .
the spi values at different time scales in the weihe river basin in november 1995 were computed to obtain their spatial distribution .
it was found that z-index was not suitable for describing the features of drought at short-time scale . the spi values at multi-time scales can be used to reflect the distribution of precipitation , which is an effective method for monitoring and predicting drought .

trapping pressures of fluid inclusions are commonly used in the estimation of ore-forming pressures and depths , but the results could be affected by various factors .
this paper studies the ore-forming pressures of gold-rich quartz veins based on comprehensive geologic characteristics of vein gold deposits and fluid inclusion systems .
the minimum ore-forming pressures of vein gold deposits have a comparatively wide range , which are from 270 ~ 290 mpa of smoky quartz vein stage for the lesser qinling gold deposits , 250 mpa of visible gold-bearing quartz veins for the wulashan gold deposit , to 70 ~ 160 mpa of gold-rich quartz veins for the dongping gold deposit .
abundant co2 in fluids is an important feature for vein gold deposits , especially for orogenic gold deposits and intrusion-related gold deposits .
co2-h2o or co2-h2o-nacl system should be used in estimation of trapping pressures of fluid inclusions .
there is a significantly negative correlation between pressures and tm , co2 , reflecting a close relationship between densities and pressures .
a gold deposit with high-density and high co2 content has a high ore-forming pressure .
in order to obtain comparatively credible data , some important factors should be considered in the estimation of ore-forming pressure sand depth for vein gold deposits , including fluid inclusion types , ore-forming tectonic environment , fracture properties and their occurrence , as well as features and densities of wallrocks
the spectral absorptions of non-pigment particulate matter in lake kuileihu , lake donghu , lake liangzi and lake honghu were measured on 58 samples collected from september-october 2007 and october 2010 . the goal was to develop exponential and power models which included the parameters of spectral slope ( sd ) , inorganic suspended matter and wavelengths describing the spectral absorption of non-pigment particulate matter .
the determination coefficient ( r2 ) , relative error ( re ) and root mean square error ( rmse ) were used to assess the performance of the models .
the average r2 value of the exponential model was 0.998 , which was higher than that of the power model ( 0.994 ) ( anova , p &lt; 0.001 ) . however , re and rmse for the exponential model ( 7.01 % and 0.015 m-1 , respectively ) were lower than those for the power model ( 15.90 % and 0.027 m-1 , respectively ) ( anova , p &lt; 0.001 ) .
these results indicated that the exponential model was better than the power model .
the mean sd value of non-pigment particulate matter from the exponential model was ( 12.21 ± 1.08 ) μm-1 , with a coefficient of variation of 8.85 % for the range of 400-700 nm . the sd in lake kuileihu was slightly higher than those of the other three lakes , but without a significant difference . this suggests that a mean value could be used to model non-pigment particulate matter spectral absorption in the four lakes .
significant linear correlations were found between non-pigment particulate matter absorption coefficient and inorganic suspended matter . the results indicate the potential to develop regional models to predict the absorption spectra using inorganic suspended matter concentration

based on the monitoring data of some reservoir landslide at bank near dam in 8 years , spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of the landslide deformation were analyzed .
the space characteristics of the deformation are reflected in differences of three aspects : region , high level and depth .
the temporal characteristics of deformation are reflected in reservoir levels and rainfalls : in the key monitored region ⅱ , only the front part was influenced by the reservoir level , while the overall deformation of this region obviously closely related to rainfall .
through the analysis , we concluded that the landslide is driven mainly by rainfall , and it has a trend of going on to stability .
however , monitoring should be continuing because of the hidden danger of the &quot; sitting behind &quot; type deformation in region ⅱ
the southern daxing &apos;anling , where tens polymetallic deposits lie , is one of important metallogenic zones in northern area of china . lead and sulfur isotope geochemistry is helpful for determining the sources of ore-forming materials .
on the basis of predecessors &apos; research , sulfur and lead isotopic characteristics of sulfides from some polymetallic deposits have been studied in this paper .
the δ34s values of sphalerite , galena , arsenopyrite , chalcopyrite , and molybdenite rang from-6 ‰ to + 4 ‰ , with mean value of zero . the δ34s values of most sulfides range from 0 to 2 ‰ with a pronounced tower effect , and without significant enrichment in the light sulfur and heavy sulfur , which suggests that the sulfur source is single and dominated by magmatic sulfur .
ratio values of lead isotope in both sulfides and related rocks range from 18.13 to 18.74 for 206pb / 204pb , 15.38 to 15.68 for 207pb / 204pb , and 37.1 to 38.93 for 208pb / 204pb .

the darongxi tungsten deposit in western hunan is spatially and genetically related to the dashenshan granite , which consists mainly of biotite monzonitic granite .
la-icp-ms zircon u-pb dating reveals that the granite emplaced at ( 224.3 ± 1.0 ) ma .
compared with other indosinian granites in south china , the studied granite is relatively depleted in sio2 ( 67.70 % ~ 70.46 % ) and k2o + na2o ( 6.68 % ~ 7.33 % ) , lower a / cnk ( 0.85 ~ 1.05 ) , but enriched in mgo and cao . and it belongs to the metaluminous or slightly peraluminous high-k cal-alkaline granite series .
the dashenshan granite is characterized by low ree concentration ( 94.3 * 10-6 ~ 122.7 * 10-6 ) , relative lree-enrichment ( lree / hree 12.5 ~ 16.4 ) , mild negative eu anomalies ( δeu 0.44 ~ 0.80 ) and obvious lree / hree fractionation ( ( la / yb ) n 17.4 ~ 24.6 ) , and significantly enriched in tungsten .
the ratios of ba / rb , ni / co and rb / sr for the dashenshan granite are relatively low , suggesting a low degree of fractional crystallization .
our geochemical data reveal that the dashenshan granite emplaced during the late stage of post-collision between the yangtze and the cathysia blocks , and belongs to i-type granite .
the underplating mantle magma led to the melt of the lower crust in the studied area , and produced a mantle-crust mixing magma which seems to be mainly derived from the partial melting of lower crustal materials rather than upper mantle .
in order to better understand the variations of surface runoff and the relationship between runoff and flood / drought in poyang lake catchment basin , time series analysis was performed for eight stream flow gauging stations loca- ted at five main rivers in the catchment basin .
the results show that , the distribution of annual runoff is uneven with a moderate annual concentration between 0.43 and 0.56 , and concentration period is between the end of may and the early of june , which is one or two months before the flood period of poyang lake .
there is great variation of yearly surface runoff , with variation coefficient ranging from o. 28 to 0.33 .
the long-term annual runoff sequences in main rivers dent- onstrate a constant increase trend , especially after 1990s , when the increase trend is more obvious .
frequency of enor- mously wet and dry year is relatively high in that area , but low for normal hydrological year , which implies that poyang lake catchment basin is more frequent to encounter drought and flood disasters .
the study of this paper indicate that the flood of poyang lake is mostly influenced by the recharge front the five river subcatchment at flood season , but controlled by the flood from the upper and middle reaches of yangtze river .
the long-term trend of stream runoff is controlled by the variation of climate changes , and impacted by human activities in the catchment basin .
circulation and dry years gives a clear illustration of the drought and flood events in the last five decades of 20th century
the regional geological mapping system , well operated in terms of its function and utilization , was briefly discussed in this paper .
the authors found in its application that this system has some shortcomings. first , in the process of measuring the regional geological section , the increasing inaccuracy due to the increasing length of the section will finally lead to the remarkable deviation of the end of the section from its actual one because of the inaccuracy in measuring the azimuth angle , grading angle and slope length .
second , before the measurement of the section in a radioactive ore district , we need to measure the γ-ray spectrometry , but the resultant data can &apos;t be involved in the regional geological mapping system .
third , the stratigraphic thickness of the special section will not be included in the calculation of the thickness of the strata in the regional geological mapping system ( rgsetion ) .
if this really happens , the thickness of the strata of these lines that go backward will be calculated again .
fourth , the attitude measured by the digital geological compass should be transformed in the tablet , but the use of the digital geological compass will be greatly limited because it can &apos;t directly display the attitude measured by it itself .
for solving these problems , the authors put forward some suggestions in this paper . in combination with the experience obtained in the field and indoor work concering the utilization of the regional geological mapping system , the authors also illustrate some practical skills in this paper
by using the vertically integrated liquid water content ( vil ) products and hailstorm sample data of 2009-2010 in guangxi , variation characteristics of vil in the cases of hailstorm are analyzed .

the higher the hailstorm &apos;s vil value is , the bigger the diameter of the hail may be .
it is considered that vil products would have fairly good directive function in artificial hail suppression such as hail cloud recognition , operation time , and bomb amount needed for the operation

time-domain analysis ( tda ) is one of the most important nmr methods used in fluid identification and porosity calculation . it shows great advantages in reservoir evaluation , but there are also certain limitations .
in order to investigate the adaptability of tda in hydrocarbon identification under different reservoir conditions , numerical simulation was used in this study to analyze the factors influencing the outcomes of tda , including longitudinal relaxation time t1 , polarization time tw , porosity , hydrocarbon saturation , hydrogen index hi and polarization function .
it is concluded that when acquisition mode d9tw is chosen , the viscosity of oil that can be measured by tda is less than 9 mpa. s .
after changing the short waiting time up to 2 s while keeping the long waiting time constant , the minimal viscosity reduces to less than 4 mpa .
we also found the intensity of differential signals correlated positively with all the influencing factors mentioned above .
with real low snr nmr data , tda can effectively identify hydrocarbon and calculate porosity only under the conditions that the differential porosities of hydrocarbon are greater than 1.5 p .

four magnetotelluric sounding profiles were designed and relevant 2d electrical structure models were obtained in order to research the electrical structure of crust-mantle in southeast coastal region of south china .
these electrical structures combined with geological background and geochemical information reveal that the west part of crust in this area became thicker because of the collision and aggregate effect , while the thickness of east section decreased rapidly due to pacific plate subduction .
the lithosphere structure in southeast coastal region of china does not simply have &quot; west thick and east thin &quot; feature . lithosphere thicknesses at two ends of research area exceed 100 km .
it is speculated that the thickness increeasing in western end is due to intracontinental compression orogeny or intracontinental collision and convergence orogeny , the thickness changes in east section may be the result of the oceanic crust retentions under the lithosphere when the period of oceanic plate subduction or the pacific ancient land mass retentions under the lithosphere . the lithosphere gets thiner in central part may relates to the intrusion of asthenospheric material .
the power of upper intrusion of asthenospheric material in large scale came from deep thermal disturbance formed by pacific plate subduction

the most serious sandstorm weather occurred in inner mongolia on march 19th , 2010 .
the dust storm started from the west of mongolia and strengthened in western inner mongolia region . the sandstorm weather systems dramatically enhanced in the mobile expansion . they formed the strong sandstorms or dust storms .
using conventional observational data and numerical data , we diagnosticly analyzed the 3.19 sandstorm process , and got the following conclusions : because of the strongly heating near the ground early , 3.19 particularly strong dust storm was leaded by instability of surface heat . the mongolian cyclone created the lifting movement .
the short wave splited from the upper-level trough and merged into the northwest air current . the mongolia cyclone transfered the strong cold front .
the inner mongolian mid-west area appeared the strong sand storm weather . the high-level cold advection triggered a frontal secondary circulation , which was vertical in the ground .
the upper air jet stream had influenced the production of the sand storm weather .
it was under the right side of the jet stream exit , where sinking branch of the jet stream fell on the ground after the ground cold front .
the front frontal zone , such as shanxi 、 hebei 、 henan 、 shandong , had produced the sand blowing or the sand storm weather

the haigou granitoids , located in the northeastern margin of the north china craton , consists of monzonite and monzogranite .
this study presents zircon u-pb age , geochemical compositions and sr-nd-hf isotopes of the haigou granitoids , to discuss the origin and tectonic setting of the magmas .
the zircon u-pb dating for the monzonite and monzogranite yields 322.9 ± 3.4ma and 320.3 ± 3.5ma respectively , indicating the magmas emplaced during the hercynian period .
petrochemical data indicate that they belong to calc-alkaline i-type granitoids with metaluminous affinity .
they have similar geochemical features such as k2o / na2o ratios being between 0.51 and 0.93 , a / cnk ranging from 0.87 to 0.94 , lree enrichment with slightly positive eu anomalies .
in addition , trace element geochemistry also displays lile ( such as rb , ba , k ) enrichment and hfse ( including nb , ta , ti , p ) depletion .
the whole-rock isr and εnd ( t ) of the haigou granitoids are 0.7054 ~ 0.7059 and-10.4 ~ -8.6 respectively .
two-stage hf model ages ( tdm2 ) of magmatic zircons from monzonite and monzogranite are 1.39 ~ 1.81ga and 1.67 ~ 2.06ga respectively , all manifesting relative low εhf ( t ) values ( -7.6 ~ -0.8 for monzonite and-11.5 ~ -5.4 for monzogranite ) .
above-stated isotopic systematics of the granitoids implies that the magmas were derived possibly from the partial melting of ancient lower crust of the mesoproterozoic or paloproterozoic ages with abundant mantle contribution .
considering their ages , geochemical and isotopic signatures and regional geological evolution , it is suggested that subduction of the paleoasian oceanic crust might be responsible for formation and emplacement of the haigou granitoids magmas

then the influences of self-organization processes among different scale vortices on the heavy rain resulting from bilis are discussed .
the main results show that the convective system resulting in rainstorms is not the convective cloudy cluster produced in the tc &apos;s spiral bands but results from the self-organization process of multiple meso-and fine-scale vortices , which is a combined effect of the outer circulation of the tc and local terrain .
the self-organization process of vortices during tc &apos;s landfalling can be classed into two phases , i .
, the double vortices self-organization process in the first phase and the multiple vortices self-organization process in the second phase .
the principal dynamic mechanism causing rainstorms during tc &apos;s landfalling is the self-organization process of local multi-scale vortices
cloud-to-ground ( cg ) lightning data observed by adtd lightning location network and precipitation data observed by meteorological observation stations located in four regions of different climatic belts of china are used to analyze the relationship between cg lightning and rainfall .
it was found that the linear correlation between cg lightning and rainfall increases with the latitude changing from low to high and the climate changing from humid to arid .
the linear correlation coefficients between the cg lightning frequencies and the precipitation related to lightning activity in the four regions changing from low to high latitudes are 0.56,0.46,0.56 and 0.80 for daily variation , 0.73,0.86,0.89 and 0.92 for ten-day variation , and 0.74,0.88,0.965 and 0.99 for monthly variation , respectively .
the cg lightning and all the precipitation in region 3 and region 4-more arid than the other two regions-also have good relationships . the linear correlation coefficients between them in region 3 and region 4 are 0.31 and 0.41 for daily variation , 0.84 and 0.52 for ten-day variation and 0.93 and 0.80 for monthly variation , respectively .
the spatial relationships between cg lightning and precipitation , although being complicated , also strengthen with the changes of the latitude from low to high and the climate from humid to arid , with the related coefficient in region 4 being 0.54 .
compared to the lightning-producing mechanism in humid areas ( resulting from both thermodynamic uplifting and large-scale interactions ) , that of arid areas ( resulting from thermodynamic uplifting ) is more unique , which is much attributed to better correlations between lightning and precipitation in arid areas

based on ncep / ncar monthly reanalyze and rainfall data at 160 stations of china , the effects of sensible heat character in north africa on the rainfall in east china are investigated .
the results show that north africa region is identified as the key area , its sensible heat has a lagged impact on summer rainfall , which means that positive anomaly leads to less rainfall in north china and more rainfall in yangtze river , and vice versa .

modeling results show that the weight function curve is of single-peak shape . with the increasing depth to the water table , the peak value decreases and the occurring time of the peak increases .
in comparison with coarse grain soils , fine grain soils will lead to a smaller peak value and a later occurring time of the peak .
the empirical formula presented in previous studies can approximately describe the single-peak shape of the weight function , it is also available for coarse grain soils and small depth to water table .
however , it is not sufficient for fine grain soils and deep recharge .
both the soil types and the initial moisture distribution in vertical profile control the hydraulic conductivity in the vadose zone and influence the delayed recharge process .
this study can provide reference for the description of variable recharge in modeling of groundwater and research on solute leaching process in the vadose zone

based on the ctd data observed during the 908 program , the distributions and seasonal changes of water temperature in the bohai sea , the yellow sea and the east china sea are analyzed systematically .
the results reveal that in winter the structure of water temperature shows horizontally many tongue- shapes , of which the warm water tongues occur mostly in the offshore area , while in the inshore area the i- sotherms are basically parallel to the coastline , with some cold water tongues directing to the south and strong temperature fronts occurring between the warm and the cold waters .
in spring and autumn , the distributions of water tempera- ture display a transitional nature .
in spring , thermocline emerges and cold water masses such as the mid- dle bohai sea cold water and the yellow sea cold water mass begin to come up .
when autumn comes , the thermocline submerges and finally disappears and the distributions of water temperature tend gradually to become uniform vertically .
moreover , the results also reveal that regional variations of water temperature are present in the three seas , and that the annual variation amplitude of water temperature distributions tends to decrease both from north to south and from the inshore to the offshore
based on the conventionally observational data from 126 weather stations in hebei province and sur- rounding area from 1971 to 2000 , the monthly mean air temperature under the tugged topography condition was simulated using a distributed model and a spatial distribution map of air temperature with the resolution of 100 m * 100 m .
the results indicate that the air temperature fluctuates weakly because of the fiat terrain in the bashang plateau and the plain area of hebei province , while the effect of the local terrain on the air temperature is significant in a range of yanshan mountain and taihangshan mountain .
the maximum air temperature difference between the south-facing slope and the north-facing slope with the same angle appears in january , then in october and april , while the minimum one occurs in july .
the air temperature difference increases with the increase of slope angle during the same period .
the air temperature fluctuates weakly and is higher than that in the surrounding area because there are many basins and river valleys in zhangjiakou area .
the simulation accuracy of the distribu- ted model on mean monthly air temperature is high in hebei province , so is the simulation capability of time and space dimensions , and it could be applied in the mountainous region
the quantitative relationship between the upper ocean near-inertial current and the local wind stress and the expressions of near-inertial energy input at the surface and the energy dissipation within the thermocline in the course of a tropical cyclone are investigated based on a simple slab model .
it is indicated that the near-inertial oscillations in the ocean mixed layer are created by the local wind stress .
as the wind stress changes with the baroclinic model of the interior ocean , the resonance mechanism is expected to oc- cur in the upper layer .
additionally , the near-inertial oscillations are amplified ( or damped ) with time when the near-inertial energy input at the surface is greater ( or smaller ) than the average energy dissipation in the mixed layer .
the quasi-geostrophic flow has no effect on the energy dissipation in the mixed layer , but has an effect on the frequency shift of the near-inertial current

the results show that the surface wind speed at 20 : 00 o &apos;clock in the heavy pollution day in harbin is the first level or calm .
there is a temperature inversion phenomenon below 850 hpa for 85 % heavy pollution days . the maximum inverse temperature is 0 . 73 ℃ / 100 m and occurs between the ground and 925 hpa .
there is a descending motion below 850 hpa for 95 % heavy pollution days .
the primary synoptic situation of heavy pollution days is high pressure edge type , high pressure center type and low pressure edge type .
it is not favorable to the horizontal and vertical transport of pollutants for the first two types , while it is favorable to the vertical transport of pollutants for the third type .
the classification of synoptic sit- uation could provide references for air pollution forecast

from july 2010 to july 2011 , high performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) was used to study sur- face microphytobenthic chl-a biomass and photosynthetic pigments at 3 stations in yundanghu lagoon , xiamen . the correlation between environmental factors and microphytobenthic pigments was analyzed .
the results showed that fucoxanthin ; alloxanthin ; zeaxanthin and chl b were detected in surface sediments , which represented the ben- thic algal community of including diatoms , eryptophyta , cyanophyta and ehlorophyta .
there was significantly nega- tive correlation of microalgal biomass between benthic layer ( surface sediment ) and pelagic layer ( water column ) ( p 〈 0.05 ) , however , it was not significant for correlation of the corresponding photopigments between the ben- thic-pelagic layer . this implied the sediment photosynthetic pigments were mainly from the contribution of benthic microalgae , rather than the sinking pelagic phytoplankton .
temporally , microphytobethic biomass was lower in smnmer ( june to august , 1.30 mg / m2 ) and higher in winter ( december to february , 86.16 mg / m2 ) .
for the spatial scale , mierophytobethie biomass was higher in shallow water than that in deep water in yundanghu lagoon , and had a well positive correlation with light intensity ( iz ) at the sediment surface ( p 〈 0 . 05 ) .
fucoxanthin had a significant positive correlation with local rainfall , while alloxanthin was significant positive correlation with dissolved inorganic nitrogen ( din ) , zeaxanthin was well influenced by temperature .
most of the photopigments had a well positive correlation with light internsity ( iz ) except for zeaxanthin .
model-based data showed that benthic mieroal- gae contributed 27.64 % and 12.56 % of chl-a and carbon fixation , respectively , in the pelagic-benthic system in yuandanghu lagoon , xiamen

in order to give insight into the reaction between acid rain and carbonate rock surface , and figure out the co2 carbonate source amount from the processes of acid rain-induced chemical weathering of carbonate rocks , two typical carbonate rock areas guilin ( representing a limestone area ) and liuzhou ( representing a dolomite area ) were chosen as the study areas in guangxi .
according to the dissolution rate calculated by the limestone test piece and gis analysis , the co2 source produced by acid rain was 41.066 * 108 g / a , with 33.349 * 108 g / a for guilin and 7.717 * 108 g / a for liuzhou .
the carbon sources of unit areas in guilin and liuzhou were 66.967 * 105 g / ( km2 · a ) and 42.777 * 105 g / ( km2 · a ) , respectively .
although the carbon sources were still less than their carbon sinks in guilin and liuzhou , which were 273.891 * 105 g / ( km2 · a ) and 43.660 * 105 g / ( km2 · a ) , respectively , they should not be neglected .
there are two reasons to explain why the degassing rate of carbon source in guilin is lower than that in liuzhou . one is the representative area of carbonate rock in guilin , where the degassing rate is 2.77 times that in liuzhou , and the other one is that the total intensity of acid rain in guilin is lower than in liuzhou , so the dissolution rate of the carbonate rocks is lower in guilin

by using daily thunderstorm data in 78 stations of anhui province during 1961-2009 , this paper calculated the sum of annual thunderstorm days in every station and established a time series , then analyzed the spatial-temporal variation of thunderstorm and its influencing factors over anhui province by trend analysis , eof , wavelet analysis , mann-kendall test and so on .
the results showed that. the annual thunder- storm days over anhui province presented a significant decreasing tendency ;
thunderstorm days in the south overwhelmed that in the north and that in mountain overwhelmed in plain ;
the seasonal distribution proved that thunderstorm days in summer ranked the first , in spring the second , in autumn the third and in winter the last ;
the thunderstorm also showed a tendency to begin later and end earlier , thus the thunder- storm period shortened ;
the thunderstorm days of all stations in anhui province decreased , and that of those stations in the southwest of the yangtze-huaihe area and the south part of anhui province decreased most sharply .
the cumulative percent variance of the eof &apos;s first three modes reached 98 . 7 % . the value of first mode of eof was consistent everywhere , meanwhile the second mode of eof indicated that the distri- bution of thunderstorm days between south and north was contrary .
thunderstorm days which mutated once around 1976 had two main periods , around 10-12 years and 2,3 years .
the spatial-temporal variation of thunderstorm was closely related to those factors such as atmospheric general circulation , latitude , terrain , season , etc
the dongpo ore field is in the western part of the nanling polymetallic metallogenic belt , which is located in the intersection between yangtze block and cathaysian block .
there are a series of large-and medium-sized w-sn-mo-bi polymetallic deposits distributed around the qianlishan granite in the dongpo ore field .
the jinchuantang deposit is a large-sized skarn-type tinbismuth deposit in the dongpo ore field .
direct re-os dating on molybdenites collected from the skarn ore in the jinchuantang deposit have been carried out , in order to further restrict the age of mineralization .
the results show that re-os model ages range from 157.2 ± 2.8ma to 162.4 ± 2.4ma , with an average of 159.8 ± 2.9ma , and give an isochron age of 158.8 ± 6.6ma.
combined with the reos isochron age ( 151.0 ± 3.5ma ) of shizhuyuan deposit and zircon shrimp u-pb ages ( 152 ± 2ma ) of the qianlishan granite , it is suggested that the mineralization of the jinchuantang sn-bi deposit is temporally and genetically related to the granite in this area .
based on previous studies , petrologenesis and metallogenesis of the dongpo ore field , including the jinchuantang deposit , mainly occurred 149 ~ 161ma , which is similar to the large-scale tungsten-tin polymetallic mineralization ( 150 ~ 160ma ) in the nanling region .
coupled with previous studies in this region , it is suggested that mantle components were extensively involved in the petrologenic and metallogenic processes of the mesozioc w-sn polymetallic ore district , southern hunan province , indicating that the middle-late jurassic explosive mineralization of this region is probably as results of crust-mantle interactions under a geodynamic setting of the lithospheric thinning and extension
a finite difference formulation is developed for computing the frequency domain electromagnetic fields due to a magnetic source in the presence of two-dimensional conductivity structures .
the main principle of this forward modeling method is to synthesize data for three dimensional signal source with a series of different wave numbers in geologic structure &apos;s strike direction ( direction x in cartesion coordinate system ) .
by the fourier trans-formation the problem is transformed into the x-wave number ( kx ) and two coupled partial differential equations for hx ( kx , y , z ) and ex ( kx , y , z ) are obtained .
these equations can be solved by finite difference method in y-z plane .
in the paper , four typical models are used for 2.5d forward modeling .
then we demonstrate the hz curves for two-anomaly bodies in different depth , two-lean-anomaly bodies and down fault anomaly . numerical modeling re-sults clearly show the magnetic anomaly of the anomalous characteristics .
finally , we simulated the inter well ex-ploration methods and obtained some good results in ey and hz

washan iron deposit is a typical porphyry-type iron deposit , with a multi-stage ore-forming process . it displays the iron mineralization evolution of the washan ore field .
based on the detailed field geological investigation , mineralogy and petrology study , the magnetite formation is divided into four stages , namely , disseminated magnetite , magnetite in breccia , coarse-grained vein magnetite and pegmatitic vein magnetite .
in situ electron microprobe and la-icp-ms analysis of the magnetite from washan iron deposit show that with the evolution of mineralization , the contents of ti , mn , v in magnetite are consistent ; the al and mg contents increased ;
the contents of ga , sn and high field strength elements ( zr , hf , nd , ta ) change in a small range ;
from magnetite in breccia to pegmatitic vein magnetite , co content gradually increased and sc decreased gradually .
the compositions of magnetite in various stages indicate that the process of magnetite mineralization has a continuous evolution with a similar source .
combined with previous studies , the mineralization formed from the iron-rich melt in the later of magmatic evolution .
the large-scale iron precipitation triggered by cryptoexplosion and the corresponding breccia pipes provide available space for the mineralization . the disseminated ores and brecciated ores formed in the early stage .
with the magmatic-hydrothermal evolution , magnetite showed more hydrothermal likely signature in the later stage

the author studied the trace element of different lithology and the results tasted that the intended interval is mainly the saltwater atmosphere with large salinity .
the carbon and oxygen stable isotope test displayed that the carbonate δ13c tended to positive anomaly and the z value distributed between 111 ~ 168.52 ;
the allocation for strontium stable isotopes is slightly higher than the same period sea and far lower than the river and lake ;
the study indicated that brackish lake basin maybe caused by marine transgression after combined with the diagnostic glauconite and collophane found in the phase and the calcareous nannofossils discovered in the sem
it is a part of the pgpi ( program for processe investigation ) to study the relationship between insoluble microparticles and magnesium , and it was initiated at the tianshan glaciological station in july 2002 .
in this paper , the vertical distribution and evolution process of insoluble microparticle and magnesium concentration along vertical profiles of snow pits as well as their seasonal variation were studied by weekly sampling from a snow pit ( 4 130 m a. s. l . , in the percolation zone ) on glacier no .
correlation coefficient between concentration of insoluble microparticles and magnesium along vertical profiles of snow layer showed a significant negative correlation with temperature
the beach-bar sand bodies in the upper fourth member of the eocene shahejie formation ( the upper es4 ) in dongying depression exhibit zonal distribution in a plane .
the secondary pore developed in beach-bar sand bodies in the study area is an important factor to form favorable reservoir .
the secondary pores can be mainly divided into carbonate dissolution pores and quartz dissolution pores , which were respectively formed in two different fluid environments .
based on the study of the secondary pore and the diagenesis in different beach-bar sedimentary areas , it is considered that the genetic types of the secondary pore vary in different structural locations in dongying depression , as the solid and fluid properties are highly different in the reservoir of beach-bar sand bodies .
the differences of solid properties are caused by the distance from the sedimentary body to the provenance and the variation of sedimentary environments , while the differences of fluid properties result from the connectivity and activity of faults near the sedimentary body .
therefore , the secondary pore of beach-bar sand bodies shows corresponding zonal distribution laterally : the secondary pore zone developed in the gravel beach-bar was mainly controlled by acid diagenesis ; the secondary pore zone existed in the coastal beach-bar was affected by interaction of acid and alkaline diagenesis ;
and the secondary pores in the offshore and the central resonance zone beach-bar reservoir were mainly affected by alkaline diagenesis
the contents of main and trace elements , total organic carbon ( toc ) and carbonate are reported in sediments recovered from the offshore areas of the shandong peninsula . the aims are to understand the provenance and diffusion pattern of the sediments by the element composition characteristics .
the results indicate that the content of some elements , such as al , k , na , mg , fe , ca , cu and zn is higher in the offshore areas than in the upper continental shelf ( ucc ) , and the content of mn , co , ni , cr as well as rare earth element ( ree ) is lower .
si and ti in the offshore areas are same as ucc.hree fractionates obviously in sand and the value of cn ( la ) / cn ( yb ) is close to that of korean rivers .
the normalized curve of other sediments is same as that in the huanghe river and different from that in the changjiang river .
the element composition mainly is controlled by source rocks and influenced by granularity .
furthermore , fe-mn oxides and biogenous carbonate also exert some influence on the element composition .
the result of provenance discrimination exhibits that the sediments offshore and in the southeastern area are mainly derived from huanghe river . where the transportation pattern of sediment is controlled by shandong peninsula coastal current and tide .
the coarse sediments in the northeast mainly are the relict sands and their element component is same as that of the korean peninsula and the yalu river .
this means that the coarse sediments in the northeast may be supplied by the korean peninsula or the yalu river in the last glacial when the sea level was low
conventional observation and physical quantities field data was used to analyze the causes of an agricultural hazard rainstorm on april 21,2010 in southeast of hubei province from the aspects of circulation , water vapor condition , kinetic condition and instability mechanism .

stratigraphic lithofacies assemblages are regularly distributed within different system tracts of the sequence stratigraphic framework .
the present paper deals with the concept , types , recognition criteria and implications of sequence stratigraphic architecture in order to effectively predict the development of reservoir and the distribution of hydrocarbon source rocks .
sequence stratigraphic architecture can be defined as the temporal and spacial relationship of the system tracts within the sequence stratigraphic framework .
the types of sequence stratigraphic architecture include type l , t , th and h with subtypes of e-h and l-h.type l sequence is usually characteristic of sand prone lithofacies with excellent reservoir properties ;
type t sequence is typical of shale-rich lithofacies containing excellent hydrocarbon source rock ;
both type th and subtype e-h are shale-rich lithofacies but subtype e-h developes less hydrocarbon source rocks than the type th , and subtype l-h is characteristic of sand prone lithofacies with relatively developed reservoirs .
as illustrated by using the sequence stratigraphic architecture of wenchang formation in the huizhou hydrocarbon-rich sag , zhujiangkou basin , it is showed that the type t sequence acts as the excellent hydrocarbon source rock in the southern margin of the huizhou sag , and the type h sequence is the good reservoir in the northern margin of the huizhou sag

in motianling area , uranium deposits occur in down-faulted zone and tongue-shaped depression zone near pluton margin , which are closely related to the accumulation zone of denudated modern materials and the water collection area of modern terrain .
a lot of data shew that the ore-forming fluid was originated from atmospheric water and the ore-hosting structures are brush-shaped .
these characteristics indicate that paleo-collapse of mountain is the main reason to cause uranium mineralization and paleo-collapse body produced the water-bearing bodies of the pre-mineralization , which provided original water for ore-forming fluid .
this paper presented several types of mountain collapse and discussed the relationgship between the formation of brush-shape structure and uranium metallogenesis in motianling area
calculation formula for normal stress and shear stress on fault plane in a triaxial crustal stress state were deduced through establishing mathematical models , and three parameters : fault sealing coefficient , fault tightness index and fault shearing index were taken as indexes to quantitatively evaluate the fault sealing ability .
analysis results demonstrate that the fault sealing ability shows better when the fault sealing coefficient and fault tightness index get greater , while the relationship between the fault shearing index and fault sealing ability is relevant to the property of normal stress that acts on fault plane .
when normal stress is a compressive stress , the greater the fault shearing index , the better is the fault sealing ability , while the opening extent of faults gets greater with the increase of the fault shearing index when normal stress is an extensional stress .
moreover , the influence of the magnitude and direction of crustal stress on the fault sealing ability was analyzed .
the result indicates that when the included angle between fault strike and the maximum horizontal principal stress changes , both the variation trend of normal stress and shearing stress on fault plane and its influence on the fault sealing ability are contrary , thus in practical application this influence should be synthetically considered .
furthermore , the fault sealing ability of compressive and compresso-shear faults is superior to that of extensional and tenso-shear faults .
numerical simulations of the tertiary tectonic stress field and analysis of the fault sealing ability in the mid-northern raoyang depression demonstrated that the sha-2 and sha-3 members should be major targets of exploration , and the sha-1 member and the dongying formation came next .
this conclusion is consistent with the exploration and development practice in the raoyang depression

the most favorable coal-accumulating epoch occurred in the late of the rising half long base level or the early of the falling half level . giving the appropriate climate and terrain conditions , the thick coal could form around the stage of maximum flooding surface epoch .
and during this epoch , the combination of the long rising half intermediate base level cycle and the short falling half intermediate base level cycle was favorable to depositing wide and thick coal seams .
the study results have provided basis for broadening exploration of deep coal resources in hegang basin

the study area is located at the southern margin of the middle qilian , south of the qinghai lake-gulei deep fault belt , which is a favorable area for copper-nickel deposits in qilian metallogenic belt .
yishichun copper-nickel ore occurs within the homologous and contemporaneous basic-ultrabasic intrusions , and copper-nickel mineralization is spatially and temporally related to the intrusive rocks .
the cathodoluminescence ( cl ) images and the th / u ratios of zircons from the basic-ultramafic rocks suggest that zircon crystals are of magmatic origin ;
the la-icp-ms u-pb dating of these zircons yields a weighted mean age of 455.1 ± 1.7 ma . therefore , the ore-bearing rock emplacement and copper-nickel mineralization occurred during the late ordovician , and the metallogenic dynamic process was probably related to an ancient continental margin rifting

third order runge-kutta time split-explicit scheme is generally used in non-hydrostatic atmospheric models .
the stability and error of this scheme is analyzed in this paper .
the amplification matrix of the scheme is of high order and high power .
the derivation of its eigenvalues formula is performed with the wolfram mathematica software which handles complex symbolic calculations and a numerical test of one-dimensional linearized sound-advection equations is performed to show the performance of this scheme .
the taylor series expansion of the norms of the eigenvalues is performed with higher-order terms kept and the splitting error term is derived out for both upwind and centered spatial differences .
the splitting error and its relationship with the number of small time steps are shown directly and quantitatively .
it is demonstrated that the scheme is numerically stable and has a smaller splitting error than second-order runge-kutta time split-explicit schemes .
the splitting error term of centered spatial differences has higher order and so the split error is smaller than that in upwind schemes .
these conclusions are also demonstrated by the analysis of the eigenvalues of propagating sound waves with different wave-length and the sound wave advection numerical experiment for the second-order centered spatial difference with the rk3 split-explicit scheme for which there are almost no differences in the forward and the backward moving mode .
moreover , the splitting error of the rk3 split-explicit scheme is also smaller than the adams-bashforth-moulton scheme

biotite and plagioclase samples from the quartz monzodiorite of xinwuli granitoids yield 40 ar-39 ar plateau ages of 152.1 ± 1.7 and 135 ± 1 ma .
samples from the granodiorite give 40 ar-39 ar plateau ages of 143.8 ± 0.9 ma and 140.4 ± 0.9 ma .
the similar ages suggest an important stage of yanshanian magmatic activity in the middle and lower yangtze regions .
the 40 ar-39 ar age of biotite from quartz monzodiorite is older than the previous zircon u-pb isotopic ages , which is probably due to excess argon .
together with the age data of xinwuli granitoids , we obtain the cooling curves of the granodiorite and quartz monzodiorite . the cooling curves show that the cooling rates of xinwuli granitoids have been fast since the late jurassic , indicating an extensional tectonism .
the formation of xinwuli granitoids may be related to the late mesozoic lithosphere thinning in eastern china

the purpose of this study is to explore the biological karst developing mechanism at the coexistence condition of the sulfate and carbonate rock .
the study focuses on the geochemical processes in water-rock-bacteria system by tracing the stable sulfur isotope ( 34s ) fractionation through laboratory experiment combined with the isotope data of the pyrite filling in ordovician weathering crust in the ordos basin .
the results suggest that the h2s produced by bacterial sulfate reduction ( bsr ) is characterized by a significant isotope fractionation of 34s , which was controlled by temperature and the so42-concentration from the dissolution of sulfate rocks in the system .
bacterial sulfate reduction in the experimental system provides an evidence for biological karst on sulfate rocks , and gives a good interpretation for the feature of karst development below the ordovician weathering crust , ordos basin .
in addition , the presence of pyrite and compacted released water karst confirms that bacterial sulfate reduction took place within the weathering crust during the burial stage .
the results provide a new perspective for the analysis of the formation of oil-gas reservoir and the exploration of petroleum gas geology resources

the miocene sediments in the linxia basin are important for understanding the qinghai-tibetan plateau uplift and the east asian monsoon developments .
hematite and goethite from the heilinding section in the southern margin of the linxia basin ( 11.8 ~ 5.0 ma ) were tested .
the content of the hematite was high in 11.88.6 ma , decreasing obviously at 8.6 ma and kept stable in 8.6 ~ 5.0 ma , whereas goethite was almost stable throughout the period .
the trend of hematite / goethite ration was similar to hematite content .
such hematite , goethite and hematite / goethite contents in the heilinding section probably indicate a strong aridification process since 8.6 ma in central asia , which was linked to the qinghai-tibetan plateau uplift during this time

the carbon sequestration ability of the greenbelts was correlated with their spatial-temporal pattern and the increase extent was greater than that of their acreage .
it is concluded that human activities impact the growth of greenbelt area , and the changes in the acreage and composition of greenbelts are the main factors influencing their ability of carbon sequestration

using the monthly mean geopotential height , wind vector at 850 hpa and 500 hpa of the ncep / ncar reanalysis data , the sea surface temperature ( sst ) of the cpc and the community atmosphere model v3.0 , we examined the impact of the preceding el ni  o event on the east asian circulation .
the results are : ( 1 ) the climate simulations show that there are two kinds of major impact of el ni  o in the mature phase on the atmospheric circulation over east asia in next early summer .
the two ways of the impacts are embodied in the development of the low level anticyclonic circulation around the philippines and the active mid-level okhotsk-japan wave-train-like pattern ( okj pattern ) that accompanies the development of the okhotsk high .
the latter one has been more easily simulated by the climate model . both the two kinds of anomalous circulation were observed from the reanalysis data .
the positive rainfall in the southern part of china with the two anomalous circulation patterns in next june was also simulated after the positive sst anomaly in the nino-3 region was added in autumn , which indicates a delayed impact of el ni  o on the east asian summer monsoon .
( 2 ) the statistic analysis indicates that the more rainfall occurring in south china is strongly influenced by the development of the okhotsk high and the anticyclone around the philippines in early summer . either of them can result in flooding in the southern china and vice versa .
the okhotsk high plays more and more important role in causing the southern flooding recently .
the okhotsk high , the rainfalls in the northern / southern china , the enso events and the anticyclone around philippines have their respective decadal variabilities , which suggests their different responses to the global climate warming
the sarekoubu-tiemurte deposits in southern altay of xinjiang occurred in metamorphic rocks of lower devonian kangbutiebao formation .
the zn-pb ( cu ) mineralization related to the early devonian marine volcanic deposition zn-pb ( cu ) and the late devonian-early carbonifeneus quartz veins mineralization related to the collisional orogeny .
the former is represented by the vms type tiemurte zn-pb ( cu ) deposit , and the latter by the orogenic type sarekoubu gold deposit , and the vein mineralization related to orogeny superposed in the vms deposit .
based on the study and comparison of stable isotope characteristics of the two types of mineralization , combined with the deformation and metamorphism of mineralization and fluid inclusions , the authors discuss the metallogenic minerals , fluids and ore genesis .
the carbonic ( co2-ch4-n2 ) fluids inclusions are widely developed in the sulfide quartz veins of the sarekoubu deposit and the cu-bearing quartz veins in late stage of tiemurte deposit , indicating that the carbonic fluid inclusions are related to the hydrothermal fluid of collision orogeny .
in the tiemurte zn-pb ( cu ) deposit , the δ34s values of sulfides in vms ores range from-26.46 * 10-3 to-19.72 * 10-3 , indicating that the sulfur mainly from the inorganic reduction and bacterial reduction of seawater sulfate .
the δ34s of sulfides from late superimposed veins is closed to the δ34s values of sulfides in sarekoubu gold deposit , indicating a deep source of sulfur in the ores .
the δdh2o and δ18oh2o in the sarekoubu gold deposit and tiemurte zn-pb ( cu ) deposit indicate the fluids in collision orogeny were related with the magmatic activity and metamorphism .
δ13c values of co2 in carbonic inclusions range from-21.15 * 10-3 to-7.51 * 10-3 , and those of ch4 range from-34.11 * 10-3 to-28.38 * 10-3 in sarekoubu gold deposit .
whereas , δ13c values from inclusions in late cu-bearing quartz veins in the tiemurte range from-8.02 * 10-3 to-6.99 * 10-3 , δ13c show a deep source or magma source that is not related with marine volcanic sedimentary

a few analytical approaches for characterizing element existing state , which include chemical analysis , chemical phase analysis , electron spectroscopy analysis , scanning electronic microscope analysis and x-ray diffraction analysis , were utilized to systematically and thoughtfully characterize the structure of phosphorite tailings and their important topographic features . the vital analytical results for the study of existing state of calcium , magnesium and phosphorus were obtained .
according to the measurement of phosphorite , the highest content of the tailings are calcium oxide , magnesium oxide and phosphorus pentoxide with the concentrations of 34.11 % , 17.65 % and 5.30 % , respectively .
meanwhile , the phase analysis indicates that the existing state of magnesium is mainly dolomite , which accounts for 99.80 % of the studied phosphorite tailings . and there are also a small amount of phosphate and silicate in it and each has the concentration of 0.10 % .
additionally , phosphorus exists predominantly in the form of apatite with the percentage of 97.08 , and it also contains a bit of iron oxide , monazite and xenotime with the concentration of 1.04 % , 0.19 % and 1.83 % , respectively .
contemporarily , calcium exists primarily in the form of dolomite , with the content of 96.95 % , and it also contains a small amount of calcite and phosphate with the percentage of 1.11 and 1.94 , respectively .
therefore , dolomite , apatite and dolomite are the main existing states of magnesium , phosphorus and calcium in the phosphorite , respectively
based on daily precipitation data from 50 meteorological stations in southwest china ( including yunnan , guizhou , guangxi , sichuan , and chongqing ) from 1960 to 2009 and ncep / ncar reanalysis data , harmonics analysis , biharmonic spline interpolation , and correlation methods were used to analyze the characteristics of autumn rainfall with climate change and its impact factors in the study area over the last 50 years .
the results show the following : autumn rainfall in southwest china is declining , and the inter-annual variation of rainfall is predominant . rainfall in the autumn of 2009 was the minimum amount for the last 50 years , due to a linear decreasing trend , and inter-annual and inter-decadal variations .
the changes of the impact factors due to climate change , and their correlation with rainfall varied with different atmospheric layers .
the surface air temperature in autumn in southwest china showed a significant warming trend , and had an insignificant correlation with rainfall .
the autumn temperature had no warming trend in the middle troposphere of 500 hpa , and had a significant negative correlation with rainfall , with a correlation coefficient of-0.34.
the specific humidity at 600 hpa had a linearly decreasing trend , and a positive correlation with rainfall , with a correlation coefficient of 0.30 .
the horizontal divergence at 700 hpa had no linear trend , and a significant negative correlation with rainfall .
the coefficients of similarity between the anomalous spatial distribution of autumn rainfall in southwest china in 2009 and the anomalously high temperature at 500 hpa , the anomalously small specific humidity at 600 hpa , and the anomalously high horizontal divergence at 700 hpa were-0.95,0.85 , and-0.46 , respectively .
the anomalous decrease of autumn rainfall in the study area in 2009 was caused by the coaction of thermodynamic and kinetic factors , of which the thermodynamic factors had more significant effects

based on the 3d global mhd numerical simulation data under extreme solar wind conditions , a dynamic 3d asymmetric magnetopause model under extreme solar wind conditions is developed .
this magnetopause model parameters are fitted by the levenberg-marquart method and this magnetopause model has the ability to describe the saturation effects of the solar wind dynamic pressure p _ d on the flaring of the magnetopause , the saturation effects of the interplanetary magnetic field ( imf ) b _ z on the subsolar standoff distance , the magnetopause indentation in the cusp region , the magnetopause asymmetry and the movement of magnetopause indentation center .
on the basis of this model under extreme solar wind conditions , the subsolar point decreases with increasing p _ d and increasing p _ d causes the decrease of the magnetopause size but almost keeps the magnetopause shapes self-similar ;
with increasing southward ( imf ) b _ z , the subsolar point decreases slightly , the flaring of the magnetopause decreases and magnetopause indentation center moves towards lowlatitude .
through analysis of the solar storm on august 1,2010 , it is found that this magnetopause model can describe the global magnetopause location and shape under extreme solar wind conditions

the passive continental margin basins of south atlantic ocean , controlled by the rifting and persistent drifting of south atlantic ocean , shared the same regional tectonic evolution background . however , due to the asymmetry and imbalance of the opening of south atlantic ocean , the development and hydrocarbon potential of basins of both sides varied .
the hydrocarbon of eastern south america concentrated in big-campos basins , typical passive continental margin basins with integrated developing phases , including prerift , syn-rift , transitional and post-rift phases , and each phase had its own unique features , developing pre-salt and post-salt petroleum systems .
whereas , the hydrocarbon of west africa focused in lower congo basin and niger delta . although the integrated features of lower congo basin looked alike the big-campos basins , the discrepancies of accumulation elements were still obvious .
besides , from south to north , the evolution phases of basins descended . when coming to niger delta in the middle of west africa , the niger delta only experienced syn-rift and post-rift phases , and was dominated by tertiary petroleum system .
this paper focused on the formation and evolution of the major petroliferous basins of south atlantic ocean and their control over hydrocarbon accumulation . the comparative study could be used as a guide to screening of strategic petroleum provinces overseas
the kalamaili ophiolitic belt in east junggar is one of the important ophiolitic belts in xinjiang , the closure time of junggar ocean represented by the kalamaili ophiolitic belt is still argued and unclear .
recently , we discovered that the hongliuxia ew-trending schistosity zone cut the kalamaili ophiolite belt is a dextral ductile shear zone , which was formed in collision process between the yemaquan arc and the junggar block .
the foliated granite and granitic ultramylonite in the ductile shear zone in the boerqiangji area are selected for zircon sims u-pb dating .
new results show that the foliated granite has a concordia age of about 348.1 ± 2.8ma with a 206 pb / 238 u weight average age of about 348.2 ± 2.7ma , and the granitic ultramylonite has a concordia age of 343.2 ± 2.6ma with a 206 pb / 238 u weight average age of about 343.5 ± 2.6ma.
zircons from the granitic ultramylonite are new formed by metamorphic recrystallization ; their ages may represent formation time of the ductile shear zone .
this indicates that the hongliuxia ductile shear zone was formed at about 343ma bp , and that the junggar ocean should be closed before 343ma bp , and the east junggar was involved in collisional orogen at the end of early carboniferous

to study the characteristics of atmospheric boundary layer over lake gyaring and ngoring , a set of three nested numerical simulations with and without both the lakes were conducted 120 h using the mesoscale numerical model rams.the simulated results are reasonable comparing with the observation data .
the obtained results are as follows : ( 1 ) the existence of both the lakes have a strong cold ( warm ) lake effect over the lake region in daytime ( night time ) .
( 2 ) the lake-land breeze simulated with rams is reasonable .
( 3 ) there is a clear convergence zone over the narrow land between the two lakes , and the strong lake breeze of the west shore of lake ngoring reduced the one of east shore of lake gyaring .
( 4 ) lake gyaring and ngoring reduced ( enhanced ) the boundary layer height over the lake during daytime ( night ) .
( 5 ) lake gyaring and ngoring significantly altered the surface energy flux , where the sensible heat flux is lower over the lakes than the surrounding land in daytime and the latent heat flux is higher over the lakes at night
located in quxu county of tibet , the dabu porphyry cu-mo deposit lies in the eastern part of the gangdise belt . the authors made high-precision magmatic zircon dating of the granodiorite from the dabu deposit .
the u-pb dating analyses show that the weighted mean ages of the porphyry from the main ore body are 16.5 ± 0.05 ma ( n = 13 , mswd = 3 , granodiorite ) and 16.1 ± 0.13 ma ( n = 15 , mswd = 1.03 , monzonitic granite-porphyry ) respectively .
the u-pb dating analyses indicate that the granodiorite from the xianjiaonang ore body has the weighted mean age of 16.2 ± 0.04 ma ( n = 13 , mswd = 0.0064 ) .
for the purpose of determining the mineralization time of the deposit , 4 molybdenite samples from the north and 6 molybdenite samples from the south were selected to conduct re-os dating .
the re-os dating yielded isochron age of 14.6 ± 0.50 ma ( mswd = 0.35 , n ) for the samples from the northern part and 14.8 ± 0.23 ma ( mswd = 1.3 , s ) for the samples from the southern part of the deposit , respectively .
based on the results mentioned above in association with data available , it is proposed that crystallization of the porphyry occurred at about 16ma , and the mineralization age of the deposits is about 14ma , in a short period with time span shorter than 0.86ma , implying the speciality of paroxysmal mineralization in the post-collision extension environment
identification of small-scale non-uniform geological structures such as small faults , pinchouts , cracks and caves etc. is one of important goals of oil &amp; gas exploration .
however , such small-scale non-uniform geological structures cannot be imaged clearly based on traditional pstm because of the limitations of resolution and / or signal-noise-ratio .
when reflected wave was attenuated and scattered wave was preserved during seismic imaging , this kind of geological structures will be highlighted and can be easier to be identified .
in this paper we present a scattered wave pstm method , by which scattered wave is extracted and imaged via the travel time difference of reflected wave and scattered wave .
numerical experiments and real data processing show that this method can identify small-scale non-uniform geological structures and provide useful data for subsequent seismic data interpretation
to improve resolution is the key point of spectral imaging .
adaptive optimal kernel time-frequency representation used a kernel function which can change adaptively with signal characteristics to weight the ambiguity function . the cross-components located away from the origin of the ambiguity plane are suppressed , and the auto-components centered at the origin are passed .
adaptive optimal kernel time-frequency representation decreases the impact of cross terms obviously and obtains a better time-frequency resolution than the methods as cwt and spwvd , which is proved by the model data .
based on adaptive optimal kernel time-frequency representation , the seismic data of the target layer in changshaling area of ying &apos;er sag are processed by spectral imaging . on the basis of spectral imaging results and sedimentary environment , a prediction of favorable zones in changshaling area was made .
the result shows that this method is not only suitable for the time-frequency analysis of seismic signal and excels the traditional methods in reservoir description , but also takes an effectiveness in reservoir prediction

the corresponding parameters estimating models have been built on the basis of analyzing and comparing multiple pore structure algorithms and intrusive mercury tests .
the models have higher calculation accuracy , and may be used to quantitatively analyze the reservoir pore throat radius distribution .
the reservoir quality aggregate index derived from the reservoir macro and micro parameters is better for reservoir validity evaluation

relationship between landslide and topographical factors is one of the focuses of study the law of regional landslide ;
however , previous research mostly focused on its relationship with factors reflected terrain geometry form ( geometry attribute factor ) . generally , there are two kinds of methods for describing topographical factors . taking the slope position as an example , and it can be depicted by classifying slope position according to geometry attribute factors ;
the research area is located in ou river in wenzhou area and the landslides occurred during 1990-2001 .
the relationship is calculated by the weights of evidence method , which is a good candidate for calculating the landslides and some single topographical factor .
the results show that higher correlation exits between relative position factors and landslide than geometry attribute factors which are common used in the risk evaluation of landslide , which indicate that the regional relative position information is more related to the landslide than the simple basic terrain geometry information , and most of the landslides occurred in relatively-low-hand region in the watershed , which is suffering from water rushing with greater intensity and more frequency

the petroleum exploration on the south area of east china sea has lasted for more than 30 years .
on the basis of the previous study results on this area for many years , it is believed that the hydrocarbon exploration potentials are great in widly spread mesozoic sedimentary basins in this area .
however , the target of previous study was at the cenozoic strata , of which burial depth is relatively shallow .
in addition , during the previous seismic surveys , some problems existed , for example , the streamer length was shorter , the volume of seismic source was smaller , and the depth of streamer and gun arrays was shallower .
accordingly , the quality of seismic profile was not good in deep strata . through analysis on the previous seismic acquisition parameters in this area , the correlation of seismic profiles , the scenario for seismic acquisition parameters has been determinated .
through field testing , it has been proved that long streamer , huge gun volume and deep depth of streamer and gun arrays are beneficial for acquiring better seismic data of mesozoic strata

in this paper , heavy minerals are identified for the 336 surface sediment samples taken from the northern east china sea shelf in 2007 .
ilmenite , garnet , zircon and rutile are picked out from heavy minerals as valuable ones . high grade of the valuable minerals are distributed in the northern and southeastern parts of the studied area .
there are several reasons for the enrichment of the valuable heavy minerals : a ) paleo-yangtze river and other rivers provided sediments rich in these valuable heavy sands ;
b ) coarse grains sediments like sand and silty sand are helpful for heavy sands enrichment ; c ) both postglacial transgression and modern hydrodynamic conditions have contributed to the enrichment of heavy minerals and d ) the modern hydrodynamics are favorable for the preservation of heavy minerals against retransportation .
the studied area can be divided into five prospecting areas based on integrated evaluation of various factors , such as grades of valuable heavy minerals , offshore distances water depth , sediment type and other relative factors .
our research has paved a scientific foundation for future exploitation of heavy minerals in the northern east china sea shelf
our research focuses on the composition and provenance tectonic evolution of the carboniferous-triassic clastic rocks in the southern margin of the tianshan .
analysis of petrology and geochemistry of detrital rocks shows that the carboniferous and triassic sandstones have a low compositional , textural maturity and high matrix content .
the unstable component of sandstones increases from the carboniferous to the triassic .
the carboniferous and permian have a similar characteristic of ree abundances , which is obviously higher than that in the triassic . the fractionation degree of light and heavy rare earth elements and the ratios of la / th and la / y descend from the carboniferous to the triassic and the th / u ratio increases , which implicate the increase of recycled sediments .
according to the distinction of detrital composition , major elements , rare earth elements and trace elements , the provenance tectonic settings of the carboniferous were continental island arcs , active continental margin and passive continental margin , and the permian &apos;s was continental island arcs and the provenance of the triassic was more similar to continental island arcs and ancient sedimentary geological bodies .
the carboniferous has a more complex provenance compared with permian and triassic provenances , which may be related to the collision between the central tianshan-yili block and the tarim block
baiyangping poly-metallic deposit , located in the central , slightly north of the lanping mesozoic-cenozoic sedimentary basin , is one of important deposits in the famous sanjiang metallogenic belt .
c , h , o , s and pb isotope geochemistry are discussed in this paper in order to find out sources of the ore-forming material and characteristics of ore-fluids .
the δ34s value of poly-metallic ore in baiyangping deposit is between-5.6 ‰ and 11.2 ‰ , with the property of thermal-chemic reduction of mesozoic to cenozoic evaporite sulfate in lanping basin .
moreover , the composition of pb isotope in ores and sedimentary rocks of mesozoic to cenozoic is also very similar , which illustrates that ore-forming metal elements derive from the sedimentary rocks of the basin .
the δdv-smow and δ18ov-smow of the ore-forming fluids are between-122 ‰ to-86 ‰ and-4.52 ‰ to-15.34 ‰ , respectively , showing that they come from basinal hot brine , supplied by precipitation .
the δ13cv-pdb and δ18ov-smow value of dolomite formed in early hydrothermal ore-forming stage are between-3.4 ‰ to 0.5 ‰ and 4.8 ‰ to 20.3 ‰ , respectively , while the corresponding values in late hydrothermal ore-forming stage are between-3.1 ‰ to 0.5 ‰ and 4.1 ‰ to 18.6 ‰ , respectively , all of which indicate that co2 of the ore-forming fluids derive from the solution of the limestone
through the analysis and research on relevant data , we conclude that on february 1,1911 , in dehua county , a destructive earthquake of magnitude 3 4 4 with epicentral intensity ⅵoccurred .
we argue that the seismic event that was reported on the third page of the time on february 27,1911 may refer to the earthquake occurred in dehua county , fujian province , not in jiujiang , jiangxi province . the reported magnitude ( m5 ) of earthquake on february 6,1911 in jiangxi is somewhat problematic based on our results in this paper

duobuza porphyry copper-gold deposit is a newly discovered deposit , which is located in the middle of tibet plateau and in the west of bangonghu-nujiang metallogenic belt .
the magmatic-hydrothermal evolution of duobuza deposit should be from magmatic stage ( around 120 ma ) to potassic alteration and mineralization ( 119-118 ma ) , then to phyllic alteration ( 118-115 ma ) , and the duration of magmatic-hydrothermal evolution probably persisted 5 million years

it is proved that there is good prospects for searching fe , cu , pb , zn , au , co deposit
analysis of early-middle permian lithofacies-paleogeography , structure and magmatism in the northwestern margin of the tarim basin and adjacent south tianshan orogen shows that basaltic magmatisms in the northwestern margin of the tarim result from the mantle plumes , while the contemporaneous post-collisional granites develop within the south tianshan orogen .
the early-middle permian depocenters in the intermediate zone between tarim and the south tianshan orogen are characterized by stable depression , and the depocenters migrates gradually toward the tarim block .
early-middle permian uplifting of the south tianshan orogen because of the post-collisional extension results in intracontinental subduction of the tarim lithosphere under the south tianshan lithosphere , and structural surroundings which is similar to the peripheral foreland basin arises in the intermediate zone . the depocenters correspond to the foredeep of the peripheral foreland basin system .
there is no clear interrelation between the early-middle permian mantle plumes within the tarim and the post-collisional extension , but the post-collisional extension of the south tianshan orogen of early-middle permian shows good coupling features with sedimentation-structure in the northwestern margin of the basin tarim

the purpose of this paper is to analyse the poly-phase differential movement and deformation mechanisms of the fault structures of the tarim basin .
based on the seismic profile interpretation , comprehensive analysis of the drilling and geologic data as well as compiling the fault system figures of the different stages , it is indicated that the main tectonic stages controlling the formation and evolution of the fault structures in the tarim basin are early caledonian , middle caledonian , late caledonian-early hercynian , late hercynian , indosinian , yanshanian , and himalayan .
during the early caledonian , the fault movement was controlled by extensional regime and formed a series of normal faults along the pre-existing basement fault belts .
during the middle caledonian and late caledonian-early hercynian , it is characterized by thrust faults , mainly distributed in the east tarim , middle tarim , tangubasi , bachu and maigaiti regions .
it is also characterized by thrusting during the late hercynian , and migrates from middle tarim , tangubasi , east mazhatag which the fault movement is intense in the early stages to the north tarim uplift and east tarim .
a series of fault belts formed in the foreland area during the indosinian , yanshanian , and himalayan , originated a lot of imbricated thrust faults , fold-thrust belts , duplex structures and salt-related structures .
the fault structure undeveloped in the stable region of the basin such as the north tarim uplift , middle tarim uplift , awati-manjar depression during the meso-cenozoic .
the fault deformation mechanisms during the paleozoic may have a bearing upon regional tectonic regime change and tectonic transform , pre-existing basement fault zone , major regional unconformity , main detachment zone .
the regional tectonic regime change and tectonic transform are mainly controlled by the time and intensity of the extension , subduction and closure at the peripheral oceanic basins during the paleozoic .
the pre- existing basement fault zone or weak zone may control the later stage fault position and orientation .
the major regional unconformity and main detachment zone may control the fault development and distribution horizons .
the fault deformation mechanisms during the meso- cenozoic maybe related to the regional tectonic regime and tectonic position .
the fault structures develop in the three environments of the foreland , stable and erosion regions during the meso-cenozoic .
the fault structures undeveloped in the stable regions of the basin .
the fault belts during the meso-cenozoic mainly develop in the foreland tectonic regime and are controlled by rapid intense rise of the peripheral orogenic belts , compression and thrusting , wrench-thrust or thrust-wrench , as well as the basin-mountain coupling at the late himalayan and detachment layers
this paper takes the bitumen-bearing reservoir in devonian k group in a zone in talimu basin as an example to discuss how to evaluate bitumen-bearing reservoir .
first of all , the effect of bitumen on the physical properties and productivity of reservoir is analyzed and then the log responses of bitumen-bearing reservoir are identified by comparing logs from two different wells . a cross-plot for identifying bitumen-bearing reservoir is created to distinguish between bitumen and shale .

based on the doppler radar data and cloud microphysical data collected by aircraft , the formation and microphysics of a convective-stratiform mixed cloud ( csmc for short ) impacted by westerly trough have been analyzed .
the results are as follows . csmc came into being from weakened zonal convective which was merged by small convective clouds .
apparent convection cells with the maximum intensity of 45-50 dbz and the maximum vertical height of 6 km were embedded in the csmc.the particle number concentrations measured by cdp , cip , and pip were 132.4-220.2 cm-3,1.54 * 10-1-6.28 * 100 cm-3and 9.09 * 10-4-7.34 * 10-3 cm-3 , respectively .
two dimensional images show that graupel is the main ice particles in the cold layer , which implies that supercooled water is adequate ;
columnar aggregates and riming particles found at-7 ℃ imply that after columnar crystal is formed by sublimation , collision and riming are important mechanisms for graupel &apos;s formation .
the average cdp spectra ( diameter : 2-50 μm ) are different with the heights , and the concentration of particles between 2 and 18 μm decreases with height rising , because water vapor condensation is stronger in the low-level , but the concentration of those between 24 and 35 μm increases , because the collision efficiency is lower in the warm cloud and small ice particle number increases with the height rising .
the average cip spectra ( diameter : 25-1 550μm ) follow unimodal distributions except for that at 4 100 m .
the average pip spectra ( diameter : 100-6 200 μm ) are discontinuous at the larger size ; the largest concentration and the spectral width occur at 4 450 m and the high number concentration between 3 200 and 4 000 μm implies that convective cells and the surrounding area provide a good environment for the growth of larger solid precipitation particles

thick conglomerate had developed in the shallow formation in the west part of the thrust belt on the south margin of junggar basin . the conglomerate segment shows no energy group on seismic velocity spectrum , the true formation velocity of the conglomerate segment can not be reflected , thereby resulted in low accuracy in velocity mapping .
in the middle and east part of the south margin , favorable targets are mostly steep structures , overthrust structures are common , both lateral and vertical formation velocities change drastically , the previous velocity modeling did not represent the shallow overthrust structures , thus resulted in low accuracy in variable velocity mapping for deep target formations .
based on the characteristics of variable velocity mapping for the south margin of junggar basin , marker bed has been used to correct velocity anomaly , eliminate the effect of abnormal seismic spectral points , and improve the quality of seismic velocity .
the distribution and impact of velocity anomaly in deep formations are basically understood by using velocity anomaly analysis method .
a velocity model has been set up to establish a reasonable velocity field by using variable velocity filling with drilling formation velocity and considering overthrust structures .
the application of the above technical measures has provided reliable structure maps for oil and gas exploration in the thrust belt of the south margin of junggar basin , and has played an important role in the exploration in this area

the first-break picking is a basic technique widely used for seismic exploration .
especially it plays an important role in refraction wave exploration and tomographic imaging . in the exploration interpretation , first-break times are directly related to the inversion result of the underground formation &apos;s velocity or slowness .
in a conventional way , first-breaks in the sliding time-windows energy ratio method are determined by the maximum energy ratio of two adjacent sliding time-windows .
for low s / n data , the picking up effect is not ideal . for high s / n data , it often fails to detect the weak refraction waves . the first arrival time is not necessarily corresponding to the energy ratio maximum value ( they may be secondary time energy ratio of extreme value ) . therefore , the sliding time-windows energy ratio of first-break picking algorithm is not stable .
based on this cognition , we put forward multi time-windows energy ratio of first-break picking algorithm . the method has the advantage of higher stability . it combines with automatic quality control technology in the implementation process of algorithm , and meets the first-break picking request of the shallow refraction wave exploration .
this method is applied to the exploration of the central part of junggar basin , and the results are encouraging

there are three tectonic evolution phases in the yinggehai basin .
they are sinistral strike-slip extension phase , crust ductile extension and thermal subsidence phase , and accelerated subsidence phase

gas reservoirs of the lower triassic feixianguan formation in eastern sichuan basin are mostly dolostones , which are distributed in the platform margin around kaijiang-liangping basin .
petrographic and geochemical evidences indicate multiple dolomitization events , and the most significant one of which was triggered penecontemporaneously by reflux of evaporative seawater .
dolostones formed in early periods had undergone various degree of recrystallization during burial , which resulted in the complex rock textures .
pore of the feixianguan formation dolostones is predominantly intergranular and / or oomoldic ( or intragranular ) , which is inherited from the precursor limestones rather than creating during dolomitization .
these kinds of pore are well preserved in dolostones , owing to early dolomitization and the resistance of dolomites to compaction

tensor gravity euler deconvolution was used to avoid calculate potential field &apos;s derivatives .
to accurately interpret the case with many causative sources . the adaptive fuzzy clustering analysis to overcome the drawbacks of fuzzy clustering analysis was used , such as ( pre-determined number of clusters , local optimization , or classification uncertainty ) .
kernel density estimation results show that tensor gravity euler deconvolution is a better estimate structural index of causative sources than traditional euler deconvolution .
the inversion results show that euler deconvolution is difficult to identify small and shallow anomaly source , a relatively large-scale and deep anomaly source near it ;
the euler solutions after filtered are coincident with the forward model , which proves that the method of adaptive fuzzy clustering analyzing tensor gravity euler deconvolution is better than that analyzed by fuzzy clustering analyzing

the multi-match relation between fault systems , sand bodies and unconformities in time and space controlled the types and distribution of reservoirs .
the margin and the end of carrying bed systems are usually the significant target areas of oil and gas migration
currently , most of mt ( magnetotelluric ) data are still collected on sparse survey lines and interpreted using 2d inversion methods because of the f ield work cost , the work area environment , and so on .

the inversion results show that this inversion method is reasonable and effective .
meanwhile , we prove that for inversion results with different element parameters , the results by joint inversion of both the impedance tensor data and the tipper data are more accurate and closer to the test model

fluid substitution is one of the important means for analyzing the impact of fluid on reservoir rock physical parameters .
during fluid substitution , wood &apos;s equation is widely used to determine bulk modulus of mixed-phase fluid . but for carbonate reservoirs , because of the low porosity of the matrix , heterogeneous filling exists in rocks , so wood &apos;s equation is not suitable any more .
instead , patchy saturation model can be applied under this situation .
through the study of an extreme case of patchy saturation model , an equation for calculating bulk modulus of the mixed-phase fluid filled with patchy saturation is given .
homogenous filled ( wood &apos;s equation ) and fully patchy saturation model are two extreme cases of fluid saturation , and the corresponding equations for the two model corresponding to the upper and lower limit of the bulk modulus of mixed-phase fluid .
taking the complexity of saturation in the real case into account , average of the two equations ( such as vrh model ) is used to calculate bulk modulus of the mixed-phase fluid .
actual fluid substitution results for the carbonate reservoir in southern exploration area is different by using wood &apos;s equation and patchy model , and the result by using vrh model is reliable

the detection of layers which thickness ( height ) is less or far less than λ / 4 ( such as thin coal bed and thin sand reservoir ) have become an important target for seismic exploration , so do the irregular 2-d ( such as undercurrent ) and 3-d bodies ( such as caves ) thinner than λ / 4 with limited width or with limited width &amp; length .
in recent years , researchers have made some progress on the above targets .
however , it is doubted that the layer with thickness ( height ) smaller than λ / 4 can be detected .
the definition of the conventional seismic resolution such as λ / 4 ( rayleigh or ricker ) or λ / 8 ( widess ) is by using the characteristics of seismic wave to verify the thickness of thin layers , which can be used to answer &quot; how thin for a thin layer &quot; .
therefore , the above resolutions should be called as &quot; resolution on thickness of thin layer &quot; .
this kind of resolution is not adaptive to estimate whether the bed is detectable .
research indicates that the essence of thin layer can be detected is that its reflection ( attributes ) could be distinguished from its background ( attributes ) . in terms of this theory , one new resolution is presented , which is called as seismic detectable resolution .
the seismic detectable resolution answers the questions of &quot; what is the minimum thickness of detectable thin bed &quot; and &quot; what is the minimum size of detectable irregular body &quot; .
in the paper , we discussed some quantitative indexes for the detectable resolution of thin layers and irregular bodies , and displayed some detection samples for thin coal bed , carbonate carven reservoirs and thin sand reservoirs

the results show that groundwater chemical type is relatively simple and mainly hco3-ca · mg type water .
fluoride in groundwater is widely distributed in the study area , and has an effect on the groundwater quality .
fluoride concentrations in shallow groundwater range from 0.13 to 1.76mg / l.the areas of high concentration are mainly distributed in south and southeast of the study area .
compared with the shallow groundwater , the fluoride concentrations in the deep groundwater are lower , and the excessive phenomenon does not appear .
fluoride concentration in groundwater has separately positive and negative correlation with ph value and ca2 + concentration , and also has some correlation with water depth .
fluoride in groundwater is mainly caused by natural factors , in addition , frequent human activities also affect the fluoride concentration in recent years

analysis is done on current situation of groundwater environment and its damage in cangzhou of hebei province .
based on the investigation of the karst disaster at the site of wujiang brige , the application of the high density resistivity method and cross-hole seismic wave ct method is studied in the investigation of karst and the results of these two methods are compared with the drilling data .
it is concluded that these two methods are suitable for the investigation in karst area . the applicability and limitation of other methods is also discussed
irrigation methods in plain areas are mainly with shallow water and deep groundwater in north china plain .
shijiazhuang plain is one of the main grain production areas in hebei province , cultivating mainly winter wheat and summer maize . increased grain production in the plain is closely related with groundwater exploitation .
hence groundwater consumption intensity for wheat and maize yield is dropping . it is therefore critical to study the impact of fertilizer use on groundwater consumption in the agricultural sector . this paper analyzed the variations in groundwater exploitation for wheat and maize production .
it also analyzed the effect of increased grain production on groundwater exploitation . furthermore , the paper discussed the relationship between fertilizer use and per-unit wheat and maize yield .
the results showed that increasing fertilizer use had led to decreasing groundwater exploitation for wheat and maize yield .
while groundwater use was 1.86 m3 · kg-1 in the 1970s , it dropped to 0.72 m3 · kg-1 at the start of the 21st century .
according to 0.17 t · hm-2 fertilizer use in the 1970s without considering yield-increasing effect of fertilization , groundwater exploitation sharp increased to get the total production levels of today .
for example , groundwater exploitation respectively increased by 10.35 * 108 m3,18.88 * 108 m3 and 20.12 * 108 m3 in the 1980s , 1990s and 2000-2005 .
from the relationship between fertilizer use and per-unit wheat and maize yield , fertilizer use reached 0.76 t · hm-2 to have the max per-unit wheat and maize yield . in the early 21st century , however , fertilizer use per-unit area was 0.72 t · hm-2 , which was close to the 0.76 t · hm-2 dose for max yield .
influenced by downstream or upstream water conservancy projects and a variety of other factors , it is hard to calculate discharge form relation curve , which is hard to set a single correlation curve or a group of curve as the changing of parameter .
so observation discharge process line method is generally used in discharge calculation . when the gate is frequently scheduled and discharge process is difficult to control , the discharge mutation without observation should be interpolated .
traditional discharge observation methods with outdated approach and lower information can not meet the demand of rapid , accurate and heavy assignment observation and prediction in the new period .
adcp mea-surement instrument solved the problem .
as a new flow instrument , adcp has high precision , high speed , and higher informationization level , which is different from traditional instruments .
the discharge data observed by adcp needs to be read and process by software .
with the consideration that hydrological stations are commonly located in the remote villages , rivers and reservoirs , safety production is crucial .
based on practical experiences in recent years , standardization construction of safety production should meet these requirements : leaders emphasizing , standardization of safety management and safety technology and device , civilization construction , promote work in all areas by key points and check of strict examine .
based on 30 years &apos; daily precipitation data from 1971 to 2000 , the authors statistically calculated the average number of days and climate probability of rain , moderate rain , heavy rain , and rainstorm in 10 days from may to december . since the condition of geological environment is poor in the main disaster area , we have lessened strength condition of strong rainfall .
then in virtue of fuzzy integrated evaluation , we have done spatio-temporal and climatic rick assessment of geological hazard on 39 counties in the main disaster area of wenchuan area , based on maximum membership principle .
the results show that there are the two high climatic risk index values in main disaster area , one is from mid-may to early july , and another is from late august to late september .
in addition , from late october to april of the next year , rainfall declined seriously in main disaster area , of which most part did not have climatic disaster .
in terms of geographical distribution , high-risk areas are mainly concentrated in the west and central of main disaster area , where the risk level is 3 ~ 4 ( high risk or great risk ) ;
well , the risk level of eastern part is 1 ~ 2 ( moderate risk or little risk ) .
however , in late july high-risk area focused on southern and eastern part

the occurrence of geological hazard is result of comprehensive effect of lithology , geological structure , topography , weather condition and human activities , and its complicated evolution mechanism can never be known perfectly with the knowledge and monitoring . the geological hazard is a typical &quot; grey system &quot; .
it is widely applied in the geological hazard assessment of the model based on the grey system .
however , because of the complication of geological hazard , this kind of assessment application can not abstract or generalize the condition which is necessary to the model , and it appears incompatibility between the assessment application and assessment object .
the traditional approach to solve it is that the condition is obtained with human subjective judgments and arbitrariness and subjectivity are inevitable .
with introducing the entropy theory , this paper modified the grey model and established the grey model based on entropy theory . it can solve this problem well .
taking qingchuan county as an example , the correctness of this modified model is verified and a high accuracy is got

the results showed that resistivity varied between different positions of sediment . in the middle and lower position , resistivity first increased and then became stable .
while in the middle and upper position , resistivity changed like zigzag , that was , decreasing , increasing ( or stable ) , decreasing , increasing and stable .
the changes of resistivity indicated the generation and distribution of natural gas hydrate in different positions .
the natural gas hydrates in the middle and lower positions had come into being while those in the middle and upper positions were still during the induction and nucleation stages . influenced by temperature gradient , natural gas hydrates generated slowly and scattered .
if gas supplied sufficiently , natural gas hydrates might generate massively in the middle and upper positions .
finally , a hydrate generation and distribution model was established based on the above-mentioned analyses

the study of near fault ground motion field distribution is one of hot points in earthquake engineering .
near-fault ground motion field distribution not only provides an input motion but also provides the range of avoiding belt of the foundation in seismic design .
based on regional geological structure , activity assessment of aimed fault and assessment of seismic hazard , using experience statistical relationship to determine seismogenic faults , the corresponding source model was set up .
combining 3-d finite element analysis and parallel computing , the long period ground motions were calculated . the method of limited-fault random synthesis was used to calculate the high frequency ground motion .
the high-frequency and low-frequency ground motions were composed to broad-frequency ground motion .
1-d equivalent linearization method was used to calculate the broad-frequency ground motion time histories of some special local sites according to survey data .
the pga distribution and the corresponding response spectra of the target region are got according to the ground motion time histories when the design earthquake occurs .
as an example , the near-fault ground motion distribution of changchun city was predicted when a setting earthquake occurred .
when an ms6.0 earthquake occurs on the jianshanzi-kalun fault , the influence range of potentially destructive ground motion is near the fault , and the distribution of influence range is along the fault .
the peak acceleration varies along the fault vertically mainly from 90 gal to 140 gal and the peak acceleration reaches 200 gal only in the southern part of changchun city .
the forecasting result has the basic characteristics of near-fault ground motion , and matches the current basic understanding of the ground motion near the fault

hydrocarbon-generating simulation experiment was proceeded using hydrocarbon source rock containing kerogen type ⅰ with uranium ( sandstone uranium ore ) added . the effects of uranium on the hydrocarbon generation by relevant parameters of simulation experiment products were studied comparatively .
the results show that uranium can facilitate the long-chain hydrocarbons cracking into low molecular weight hydrocarbons at the temperature above 400 ℃ , as a result the molecular weight of hydrocarbons products is lowered .
the degree of dry gas increases , while the co2 and h2 are largely generated , and the uranium lowered the variation temperature for about 50 ℃ .
uranium can lower the peak temperature of total liquid hydrocarbons generating .
350 ℃ is the transition temperature of alkenes yield , above which alkenes changes into alkanes .
uranium can enhance the isomerization of alkene produced in the simulating experiment , and make the molecule lattice of alkene member arraying more closely .

according to the studies of rock types and reservoir space features of carboniferous volcanic rocks in the santanghu basin , there were two kinds of environments for volcanic rock generation including subaerial and subaqueous in the study area .
based on core description , casting chip , scanning electron microscopy and element analysis , the generation features of volcanic rocks under the two different environments and the corresponding influences on reservoirs were discussed from the aspects of diagenetic effects .
it was concluded that different diagenetic effects influenced volcanic reservoirs in different extents .
the volcanic rocks which erupted and deposited on land in the study area were severely filled by zeolites and chlorites , and then improved obviously due to weathering and leaching .
the extent of weathering and leaching was closely related to the improvement of reservoir .
the volcanic reservoirs which deposited under water were improved owing to organic acid erosion . primary pores were seldom found and a large amount of matrix dissolved holes generated .
the generation mechanisms of subaqueous volcanic reservoirs pointed out new areas for explorations in the future

in order to obtain relatively realistic large-scale circulation in the regional model , the nudging technique is used in the coarse domain with 27 km spacing . compared with the ncep reanalysis , the model can reasonably reproduce the madden-julian oscillation ( mjo ) and quasi-biweekly oscillation ( qbwo ) .
the simulated tropical cyclone activity ( including frequency , track and intensity ) is fairly comparable to the observation .
in the 9 km domain , together with the well-simulated tropical cyclone structure such as the eyewall and warm-core , the simulation well captures the westward prevailing tracks and landfall processes .
further analysis suggests that the model can also simulate the tropical cyclogenesis including a two-step development of the convection , as suggested in previous studies .
the initial vortex appears around the monsoon trough , accompanied with cyclonic phase of the qbwo.in the first development process , the initial vortex evolves into an extremely convective core .
after a short time decline , associated with the favorable large-scale circulation , the extremely convective area is compassed by the high humidity air , which causes the second development process
the environmental dose rate ( d ) in luminescence dating can be influenced by water content , cosmic ray , factor a , radon escape , etc .
a series of detailed quantitative calculations were applied to the sample a1 with given u , th and k content for d values using different parameter values of water content , cosmic rays , factor a .
the calculations show that the greatest influence is up to 50 % with the changes of water content , and the influence from cosmic rays is up to 15 % .
the influence from factor a is relatively smaller because it usually is a given constant value . the radon escape will bring an error no more than 8 %
based on the data of drilling and logging , paleo-pressure of chang 7 undercompacted shale in xifeng area was restored by using statistic analysis , buried history simulation and formation pressure calculation .
the results show that the formation porosity is always influenced by buried depth and geological time . the influence of geological time on porosity is working all the time in the whole buried process , but depth effect would cease during uplift .
the total porosity of undercompacted shale can be considered to be a sum of normal compacted porosity and undercompacted porosity increment .
the normal compacted part is influenced by buried depth and geological time , but the undercompacted porosity increment is controlled only by buried depth .
there is a good exponential relationship between undercompacted porosity increment and buried depth of chang 7 shale .
porosity of chang 7 undercompacted shale during accumulation period could be easily figured out by employing this function in combination with formation buried history .
significant overpressure develops in chang 7 undercompacted shale during accumulation period . the pressure coefficient mainly ranges from 1.3 to 1.65 , which reflects a strong hydrocarbon expulsion power in the source rock during that time , meanwhile , it could well explain today  s reservoir distribution in xifeng area

the magnetic fabric parameters of the zhuganhe loess-palaeosols profile on the northern slope of the dabie mountains show that the mean values ( pj &lt; 1.02 , f &lt; 1.02 ) of the upper ( 0 ~ 1480cm ) strata is less than that of the bottom .
f-l and pj-q plots of the samples very clearly indicate that the samples have oblate ellipsoids fabric , and the magnetic foliations are dominant over magnetic lineations .
stereographic projection of anisotropy of aximum magnetic principal axis shows that the direction of declination of the upper strata is relatively dispersing with inclination of the long axis smaller than 15 ° and short axis bigger than 60 ° , however , the bottom is relatively concentrating with inclination of the long axis smaller than 10 ° and short axis bigger than 80 ° ;
generally , magnetic fabric characters show that the upper strata is aeolian deposit and the bottom is hydraulic deposit .
the stereographic projections of the k1 and k3 demonstrate that the wind direction in the comparatively upper strata is nw-se , while the direction of water flowing in the bottom strata section is sw-ne , which is corresponding to the trend of the zhugan river , the k1 optimal directions of ams may be controlled by the uplift of the dabie mountains

utilizing fem numerical program , the process of transient seepage field &apos;s changes is simulated , and the spatial distributions of pore water pressure and location of phreatic surface under different boundary conditions including different filling rate and sluicing rate are obtained .
based on the seepage results , the regulations of stability change under correspondent boundaries are analyzed using morgenstern-price limit equilibrium method .
the analysis reveals that seepage field in this landslide is subject to a little affection of reservoir water level due to a few front part involved immersion in water , which results in the change of stability by 1.2 % ~ 1.7 % .
during the process of filling and sluicing of reservoir , the factor of stabilities decreases at first , then increases .
the greater of filling rate and sluicing rate , the bigger and prompter of the decrease of the stability .
the results show that the rate of filling and sluicing plays an important role on the change of the stability for reservoir landslide

a nearly 1 500-year time series inferred from annual layer thickness , gray level , and oxygen isotope variation during ( 8 630 ~ 7 050 ) ± 50 abp has been established , with the support of three 230th ages and annual layer-counting results of a stalagmite ( no . nh6 ) from nuanhe cave in benxi city of liaoning .
the similarity in microstructures of annual layer among nh6 , shihua cave from beijing and glacial phase of hulu cave from nanjing , and the diagnostic annual-seasonal cycling interfaces which is typical in northern china , suggest clearly that the annual growth of stalagmites is dominated by climatic factors in the monsoon zone of east china .
the layer thickness and gray level vary synchronously in decadal-centennial scale ( correlation coefficient r = 0.56 , n = 1 580 ) , indicates the inner relationship between incoming material ( like organic substance and so on ) and dropping-water saturation in the caves when precipitation changes dramatically in different seasons .
their power spectrum analysis show periodic changes of 2 ~ 11 years , which is coincide with modern monsoon precipitation change .
the different variation history between annual growth rate and oxygen isotope , may be caused by the complicated mechanism when cave environment responsed to large scale monsoon climate

slope is a chaotic dynamic system influenced by various factors . it &apos;s difficult to establish the deterministic equation of slope displacement since it is highly uncertain as a macro expression of the internal mechanical behavior of slope .
landslide is a genetic type of slope which has the same characteristics .
apart from groundwater , the major external motivation of landslide displacement , it is under the control of remedial measures after its treatment .
chaotic time series of landslide displacement and its influential factors could reflect the history of landslide displacement .
according to the observed multivariable time series and the mapping relation between variables reflected by adopting rbf neural network , the displacement is predicted by reconstructing the dynamic system of landslide displacement .
results show that multivariable time series model could effectively predict landslide displacement , and the accuracy is higher than that of single-variable time series model ;
multivariable time series model is of clearer sense of the physical mechanics and reflects the real characteristics of deformation evolution
the 12 may 2008 ms8.0 wenchuan earthquake is one of the most catastrophic event in the past 60 years in china . great attention has been paid by a lot of scholars . in this paper , we studied the pre-seismic deformation characteristics of ground tilt along the earthquake rupture zone and leveling across the rupture zone .
we showed that before the eartthquake some tiltmeters installed along the longmenshan seismic belt were in operation and no significant changes have been observed at kangding , wenchuan and maoxian stations , and there were also no reliable precursors among 6 cross-fault levelling observation sites , except the large changes observed at the gengda site which has been denied as a precursor anomaly by mathematical modelling .
we analyzed the regional seismic activity data and significant deformation anomalie on south-northern seismic belt , and studied the strain accumulation process of wenchuan earthquake .
we proposed that no significant short-term precursory changes around the epicentral area was possibly related to the properties of high-strain but small deformation state prior to the main shock , but the factors of deformation measurement sites and the kinds of measurement instruments could not be excluded

the concentration and distribution pattern of heavy metals of cu , mn , pb , zn , cr , fe , hg , cd in the surface sediments of the yangtze estuary and its adjacent areas were studied .
hakanson index method was used to evaluate the pollution level of the heavy metals of cu , pb , zn , cr , hg , cd and their ecological vulnerability .
it is found that the elements of cu 、 mn 、 pb 、 zn 、 cr 、 fe are distributed in a declined pattern from the coast to the offshore within the estuary and its adjacent areas . the contents of these heavy metals are , in general , higher in the xiangshan county and zhoushan islands rather than in the northern part .
hg is higher in the southern estuary and declines from the west to the east , while cd is high in the south but lower in the middle estuary .
ecological assessment proves that the major part of the surface sediment in the yangtze estuary and its adjacent areas is slightly vulnerable except some sites which are in the rank of moderate ecological risk .
the risk index of these heavy metals are in an order of cd &gt; hg &gt; cu &gt; pb &gt; cr &gt; zn .
the heavy metals which might bring ecological danger to the environment within the estuary and its adjacent areas are firstly cd and then hg .
according to the results of cluster analysis , we conclude that xiangshan county and the offshore area out of the yangtze estuary up to the southwest of the cheju island are more vulnerable , and , therefore , more attention is required

observational and national centers for environmental prediction ( ncep ) analysis data are used to diagnose the characteristics of synoptic circulations , sources of water vapor , and mesoscale convective systems ( mcs ) related to the formation of heavy rainfall on july 21 , 2012 .
results indicate that the locations and intensities of upper-to lower-level synoptic circulations and mid-to low-latitude systems are favorable for the heavy rainfall formation over north china that occurred under typical weather patterns with high pressure to the east and low pressure to the west .
synoptic systems such as vortices , shear lines , troughs , cold fronts , and low-level jets affect the formation and intensity of heavy rainfall .
tropical cyclones in the bay of bengal and the western pacific ocean provide favorable conditions for the transportation of water vapor from the ocean to the mainland .
the sources of water vapor to north china are the bay of bengal , the bohai sea , and the yellow sea . water vapor in the lowertroposphere is mainly transported from the latter two sources , and water vapor in the middle troposphere is mainly transported from the former .
the entire heavy rainfall process involves two stages . during the first stage , the trigger-ing of mcs is associated with cold air invasion , terrain , and easterly wind in the prefrontal area . during the second stage , the organization and intensification of mcs are forced by the cold front .
under favorable synoptic circulations , the frequent development of stable and persistent mcs is important for the formation of the heavy rainfall event ex- amined in this study
glacier mass balance is the most direct and reliable parameter to reflect the status of a glacier .
based on the measured stakes / firn data from 2008 to 2012 , the mass balance of the xiao dongkemadi glacier was calculated .
combined with related meteorological data , the influence factors on the variation of mass balance were analyzed .
the results showed that the glacier terminus retreated by 19.7 m from 2009 to 2012 with an average annual retreating ratio of 4.9 m , 2.3 times of that in the middle and late 1990s .
in the same time the equilibrium line altitude was 5 720 m , 120 m higher than that in the early 1990s .
compared to that in 1995 , the glacierized area shrunk 0.095 km2 and the terminus altitude rose 40 m . the mass balance was-1 584 mm w .
, equivalent to 1.76 m ice reduction , during the observing period . particularly , in 2009 / 2010 the mass balance reached-996 mm w. e . , the maximum negative mass balance throughout the whole observation period in the glacier .
the higher summer air temperature and lower albedo caused by the pollution due to maintaining the qinghai-tibet highway were the main reasons for this value .
it is found that both air temperature , especially the summer air temperature , and the net radiation are the controlling factors of the mass balance
due to the model error and smooth joint problem of fitting quasi-geoid using polynomial fitting method , a new method of whole fitting quasi-geoid using bp neural network was proposed in this study .

the results show that the new method could reduce the model error in the case of a bigger area and the anomalous difference between two kinds of quasi-geoids .
the new method can obviously improve the inner and outer precision of fitting two kinds of quasi-geoids than the whole and divisional polynomial surface fitting method .
the bp neural network is a feasible fitting method for finishing local high precise and high resolution quasi-geoid

in this paper , landsat tm and etm + data are utilized to retrival the albedo on the qiyi glacier in the qilian mountains by using different equations to convert narrow band to wide band snow cover .
a best inversion formula is chosen based on error analysis .
it is revealed that the equation proposed by duguay and leddew ( 1992 ) is able to guarantee four images , whose inversion with measured value has absolute errors within 0.05 .
inversion albedo from the equation might input to the mass balance model and the distributed glacier mass-energy balance models more accurately , improving glacier mass balance study
the national centers for environmental prediction ( ncep ) reanalysis data and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) extended reconstructed sea surface temperatures ( ssts ) are used in this study to investigate characteristics of the east asian winter monsoon ( eawm ) at various latitude zones .
on the basis of two indices describing the strengths of the low-latitudinal eawm ( eawm-l ) and mid latitudinal eawm ( eawm-m ) , theirvariation characteristics , associated atmospheric circulation , and related sst patterns are examined .
the results indicate that although both the eawm-m and ewam-l indices can reflect the intensity of the eawm , the atmospheric circulation associated with the two indices is clearly distinct .
in the lower troposphere , the eawm-l is closely related to anomalous circulation around the south china sea and the philippines , while the eawm-m presents a closer relationship with the circulation adjacent to lake baikal , known as the baikal blocking high .
in the middle troposphere , the close relationship of eawm-m and the baikal blocking high remains persistent , while the eawm-l has a relatively closer linkage with a major asian trough .
in the upper troposphere , variation in the intensity of a subtropical westerly jet may modulate secondary circulation and is eventually linked with the eawm-l index , while the variation of eawm-m is mainly related to a shift of the north boundary of the westerly jet .
in addition , the eawm-l is significantly correlated with ssts in the central and eastern equatorial pacific and that in the tropical indian ocean , while the eawm-m has a closer relationship with the latter than with the former .
the close relationships of the eawm-l with the central and eastern equatorial pacific and with the tropical indian ocean are clearly revealed on interannual and interdecadal scales ;
however , the significant linkage of the eawm-m with the tropical indian ocean exists mainly on the interdecadal scale

the sensible and latent fluxes from 1st july , 2010 to 30th june , 2011 in permafrost region of the mahan mountain were calculated by using meteorological-gradient approach . at the same time , the characteristics of the surface energy balance were analyzed in combination with net radiation .
it is found that : the net radiation in this region has significant annual variation , a little more than that in xidatan and less than that in tanggula of the tibetan plateau ;
the net radiation in permafrost region of mahan mountain mainly converts into sensible heat in winter and spring , and converts into latent heat in summer and autumn , similar to the characteristics of annual variation of sensible heat flux and latent heat flux in the permafrost regions of the tibetan plateau ;
the annual average latent heat flux is a little more than the sensible heat flux in permafrost region of mahan mountain , because of the protective effect of marsh landscape and adequate moisture condition in this region .
in addition , the existence of underground ice protects the permafrost effectively in the region

based on methyldiamantane and methylphenanthrene maturity parameters , the light oils in the southern chepaizi uplift were found to be at a highly to over mature stage ( equivalent vitrinite reflectance of about 1.3 % – 1.6 % ) .
combined with the evolution characteristics of potential sources rocks in the peripheral depressions , we suggested that these oils probably were generated from the permian source rocks with high to over maturity , rather than the jurassic source rocks .
geochemical characteristics of the light oils in this region were significantly different from that of permian source rock , but similar to that of cretaceous and paleogene source rocks , inferring that aboundant biomarkers in these highly mature light oils probably sourced from the pollution of soluble organic matter in low mature source rocks during the migration process .
this conclusion is not only significant for investigating the oil and gas accumulation in the chepaizi uplift , but also can provide a reasonable evidence for re-understanding the origin of light oils and natural gases from the deep sags and the foreland depression belts in the southern junggar

xinjiang baiyanghe be-u deposit is the largest be deposit in asia .
the deposit is typical hydrothermal in origin , characterized by veinlet disseminated and mainly developed on the contact zone between a late carboniferous granite porphyry and late devonian intermediate-acidic volcanic rocks .
fluorite , as the main gangue mineral of the deposit , is rich fluid inclusions .
the homogenization temperature of the primary inclusions ranged from 237 to 372 ° c ( n = 40 ) , with an average of 308.5 ° c , suggesting that the baiyanghe be-u deposit is a kind of intermediate-high temperature hydrothermal deposit .
the chondrite-normalized ree diagram of the fluorite is characterized by enrichment of mree ( ( la / gd ) n = 0.60 – 0.66 ) , with strong negative eu anomalies and v-shaped pattern .
similar to isotopic compositions of the granite porphyry ( ( 87sr / 86sr ) i = 0.7143 – 0.7466 , εnd ( t ) = 4.06 – 5.29 ) , fluorite shows high initial sr isotope ratio ( 0.7106 ) and positive εnd ( t ) values ( 2.95 – 3.50 ) , indicating the ore-forming fluid was possibly late magmatic-hydrothermal differentiated from the granite porphyry .
as characterized by high temperature and low salinity of the primary fluid inclusions in fluorite , it is deduced that the ore-forming fluid was probably originated from mixing of magmatic hydrothermal and meteoric water

the bainiuchang deposit , located at the central tin-polymetallic ore belt of southeast yunnan , is associated with large scale ag , pb , zn reserves . however , the genesis of the deposit is controversial .
with early pb isotopic data of ore minerals from the bainiuchang deposit , former researchers concluded that lead was mainly derived from the leaching of basement rocks , and the deposit was formed through two mineralization stages , i .
, hydrothermal sedimentation stage and magmatic hydrothermal metallogenetics stage .
lead isotopic composition of the bainiuchang deposit was systematically studied with the latest lead isotopic data in this study .
the pb isotope ratios of ore minerals from the bainiuchang deposit are 206 pb / 204 pb = 17.264 – 18.537,207 pb / 204 pb = 14.843 – 15.862,208 pb / 204 pb = 38.481 – 39.424 .
the pb isotope ratios of the samples from regional strata and drilling of mining strata are 206 pb / 204 pb = 18.307 – 19.206,207 pb / 204 pb = 15.622 – 15.809,208 pb / 204 pb = 38.436 – 39.932 .
the orebodies have lead isotopic compositions similar to those of feldspar in granites , but are different from those of strata samples . therefore , lead in the bainiuchang deposit was mainly derived from magmatism , but may be contaminated slightly by strata in the process of magma intrusion .
based on geological characteristics and recently geochemistry and chronology data , sedimentary mineralization is not the main process in the bainiuchang deposit , and magmatism is the key factor for mineralization
the gps technology has been widely applied in the dynamic monitoring for large bridges or other engineerings with its advantages of all-weather , high precision , high frequency and real-time .
but the mintoring data would inevitably include the gross error and noise because of all kinds of factors , and the processing and analysis of the data would be effected by the abnormal values and noise .

in order to find out whether the method based on water or the one based on mercury saturation is better for calculating the fractal dimension of the pore structure of low permeability reservoirs , this paper takes the 41core plunger sample of upper triassic xujiahe formation reservoir as an example to calculate the fractal dimension of the pore structure by two methods separately .
the results show that the fractal dimension calculated by mercury saturation corresponds with the displacement pressure , sorting coefficient and other pore structure parameters well , the displacement pressure increases while the sorting coefficient decreases with the increase of fractal dimension .
while on the other hand , the fractal dimension calculated by water saturation corresponds with the displacement pressure , with poor sorting of coefficient and other pore structure parameters , to analyze this phenomenon .
it is hoped that the mercury injection data obtained by conventional mercury injection techniques can be used to calculate the fractal dimension of reservoir pore structure if possible

the origin of feixianguan reservoir bitumens in the northeastern sichuan basin has been controversial for a long time . previous knowledge mostly was based on geochemical data , and less hydrocarbon generation procedure was taken into account .
in this study , basin modeling was used to investigate oil generation histories and resource potentials of three probable hydrocarbon source rocks ( the lower cambrian , the lower permian and the upper permian mudstones ) for the feixianguan reservoir bitumens in northeastern sichuan basin .
the results showed that the main oil generation stages occurred in the permian-early triassic period , early-middle triassic period and late triassic-early jurassic period for the lower cambrian , lower permian and upper permian mud source rocks , respectively .
with respect to resource potentials , the lower silurian mudstone source rocks produced the largest amount of oils during the whole middle-late triassic period , accounting for 80 % – 90 % of the total oils generated by the three sets of source rocks .
during the early jurassic sedimentary period , the upper permian shalewas the primary oil source rocks in the puguang area and the lower silurian shale became sub-ordinary , only accounting for 10 % – 20 % of total oils generated during this period .
however , the lower silurian shale source rocks contributed about 80 % of oils in the luojiazhai area .
considering absolute oil quantities generated in the middle-late triassic period much more than those in the early jurassic period , the oils in feixianguan giant paleo-pools were believed to be sourced from the lower silurian hydrocarbon source rock and a minor contribution from the permian shale source rock , and its contribution is variable in different regions .
it was worthy to note that the huge quantities of oils generated from the lower cambrian shale were not trapped in the feixianguan paleo-pools , because their generation was prior to the formation of feixianguan reservoirs .
regional geological survey and outcrop sampling have been carried out in the shuanghu region of qiangtang basin to evaluate the existence and the basic accumulation conditions of gas hydrate deposits .
as evidence of gas hydrate leakage , cold seep carbonate was found in the buqu formation of jurassic in shuanghu region . the carbonate is different with those found in the northern south china sea , the gulf of mexico and the north sea .
the carbon and oxygen isotopes of the samples vary between-30 ‰ and-25 ‰ ( pdb ) and 4 ‰ to 5 ‰ ( pdb ) respectively , indicating that the hydrocarbon gas is of thermal origin .
thus the buqu formation in shuanghu region is considered as a potential exploration target after integrated geological evaluation . the factors favorable for the genesis of gas hydrate are as follows .
( 1 ) the oil shale in the early jurassic quse formation is rich in organic matter with favorable organic matter type and high thermal maturity , and could be a good source of hydrocarbon supply ;
( 2 ) fractures and cavities available in the grained dolomite of the buqu formation make the dolomite a good reservoir for gas hydrate accumulation ;
( 3 ) the regionally distributed mudstone , gypsum , marls and permafrost zone provide good caprocks

snow chemistry on the glaciers of high mountains is good indicator for studying atmospheric environment change . during the summer of 2006 , snow samples were taken from three snowpits at different altitude on the laohugou glacier no .
12 in the west qilian mountains of china , and then snow chemistry characteristics of the samples were measured . correlation analysis and sea-salt tracing methods were used in this study to reveal the sources of major ions and dust particles .
it is found that major ions in the snow have obvious seasonal variation . the major ionic concentrations rank as ca2 + &gt; so2-4 &gt; nh + 4 &gt; no-3 &gt; cl- &gt; na + &gt; mg2 + &gt; k + .
ca2 + is the dominate cation , and so2-4 is the dominate anion .
the ionic correlation coefficient analysis shows that all the ions , except no-3 , have very good correlation .
the glacier regions are mainly affected by dust activities .
moreover , the major ions , especially na + and cl- , are significantly affected by ocean in west , owing to precipitation mainly coming from west . besides , there are part ions originating from the dust sources in central asian
the relationships of the march precipitation anomalies over south china with the associated circulation and the global sea surface temperature ( sst ) field are analyzed by using observations of march rainfall over south china , noaa sst data , ni o3.4 index , and ncep reanalysis data for the period 1951 – 2005 .
the possible causes of the march precipitation anomalies over south china were revealed from the point of view of the atmospheric circulation and sst field .
the results show that when march rainfall over south china is above ( below ) normal , a cyclonic circulation ( an anticyclonic ) anomaly exists in the middle-low-level of the troposphere over the north pacific ocean , and an anticyclonic ( a cyclonic ) circulation anomaly appears over the western pacific ocean and the south china sea .
these circulation anomalies are favorable ( unfavorable ) to the southeast warm – moist air flow and the abnormal cold air in the east ofnorthern china which form a water vapor convergence over south china , leading to a significant increase ( decrease ) of precipitation .
further analysis showed that the el ni o-southern oscillation ( enso ) and north indian ocean and south china sea sst are important external factors that influence the march precipitation anomalies over south china .
the influence of enso on the march precipitation anomalies over south china is through the western pacific subtropical high and low-level wind field anomalies , and the influence of the north indian ocean and south china sea sst on the march precipitation anomalies over south china is affected by the vertical circulation and low-level wind field anomalies , as well as the abnormal western pacific subtropical high
long-chain alkyl diols , including 1,13-c 28,1,13-c 30,1,14-c 30,1,15-c 30 and 1,15-c 32 diol , are identified in suspended particulate matter ( spm ) at different water depths and surface sediments from the huguangyan maar lake .
the highest percentage of diol is 1,14-c 30 in the spm of surface water .
the highest percentage of diol is 1,15-c 30 in the spm of mid-depth water , and the highest percentage of diol is 1,13-c 30 in the spm of bottom water .
it can be deduced that 1,14-c 30 diol is mainly derived from diatom , and some possibly derived from dictyochophyceae , 1,13-c 28 diol from eustigmatophytes and diatom , and 1,13-c 30,1,15-c 30 and 1,15-c 32 diols from eustigmatophytes in the huguangyan maar lake .
the distribution of diols in the surface sediments is similar to that in the spm of mid-depth water , suggesting that the long-chain alkyl diols in sediments are derived from phytoplankton algae in the hguangyan maar lake .
the significant positive relationship between measured watertemperature and diol isomer index ( dix ) of the spm in water , and the consistency of dix in the surface sediments suggest that dix can be used as a palaeotemperature proxy in the hugaungyan maar lake

mesozoic and cenozoic deposits occur widely in the eastern depression of the north yellow sea basin . the jurassic and cretaceous are the main targets for hydrocarbon reservoirs .
based on the data from the surveys recently conducted for oil and gas resources , and together with the data from regional geological surveys in the region , we studied the characteristics of the cretaceous reservoirs in this paper .
our results indicate that the reservoirs in the study area are low or very low in both porosity and permeability .
the storage spaces are mainly provided by secondary interstitial pores formed by dissolution and fracturing .
the deposits have suffered from various types of diagenesis , such as compaction , cementation , replacement , and dissolution .
the strong compaction and cementation obviously play a great role in control over the poor reservoir properties , but the weak dissolution and fracturing may improve the reservoir properties to some extent

on the basis of the fog droplet spectrum and visibility observations in zhanjiang during a sea fog event in the spring of 2010 , the microphysical characteristics and the correlations among microphysical properties , such as the fog droplet number concentration , the liquid water content , and the fog droplet mean diameter , were analyzed , and the dominant physical processes that govern the sea fog event were discussed .
the result showed that the average fog droplet size distribution was in good agreement with the junge distribution .
in the development and mature stages of the sea fog , the broadening process of the fog droplet spectrum and the positive correlation between and showed that activation and condensational growth were the main processes .
turbulent mixing tends to make the droplets homogeneous , with a central diameter of approximately 3.5 μm .
simultaneously , turbulence causes an exchange between the inside and outside air , concentrations from outside air nucleation resulting in higher number concentration , and the condensational growth results in larger droplets
statistical analysis on the earthquakes with magnitude greater than 2.0 in the three gorges area shows that the tectonic earthquake and collapsed earthquake have different corner frequency . the majority of the former is above 5.0hz , and that of the latter is comparatively lower , around 2.5 ~ 4.5hz.
the collapsed earthquakes mainly occurred in the region with many mines and karst , such as xietan , zigui county , huofeng , badong and so on .
and the tectonic ones are prone to occur along the faults
the extratropical transition ( et ) process of a tropical cyclone will lead to a variation in the rainfall rate and distribution , which has long been a challenge to weather forecasters .
based on chinese meteorological administration t106 data , satellite observed temperature of black body ( tbb ) data issued by japanese meteorological administration and the pennsylvania state university / national center for atmospheric research ( psu / ncar ) numerical model mm5 output , the change of rainfall related to typhoon winnie ( 9711 ) during its et process is analyzed .
results indicate that the rainfall distribution displays a remarkable asymmetric feature . the heavy rainfall centers occur mainly in the northern part of the typhoon at first , and then move to the northeast and southeastern part of the typhoon circulation , revolving around the typhoon center clockwise during the et process .
meanwhile , the vertical structure of the typhoon vortex slants with height , inclining considerably to the north at its transformation stage , then tending to become perpendicular at its re-intensification stage , and inclining to the southeast afterward .
we found that the heavy rainfall occurs in the slanting direction of the typhoon vortex .
on the other hand , the rainfall locations were also related to the thermal advection activities in the typhoon circulation , which have a good relationship with warm air advection at the lower layer .
moreover , the vertical component of the convective vorticity vector can reflect the impact of the wind vertical shear and mesoscale frontal zone in the et typhoon circulation synthetically .
its high value area at 800 hpa can indicate the heavy rainfall position within the typhoon circulation

the tectonic evolution of the klippe had continued from late indosinian to himalayan epoch .
the studying on the klippe is of great significance for the tectonic evolution of longmen mountain
taking elevation component time series of gnss permanent stations as examples , effects of data defect and noise level on results of gnss time series analyzing are discussed based on both simulation and observation data .
the results show that the higher the noise level is , the greater the effect will be .
if the days of data defect are the same , the effect of continuous data defect is much greater than the effect of discrete data defect .
the interpolation can &apos;t remedy the data defect effectively in a high noise level if days of data defect are more than a certain number of days .
on the basis , the request of observation data in different reliability requirements is discussed .
it is pointed out when annual and shorter periodic variations are considered and to ensure deviation of linear velocity be less than 10 % , for example , when the noise lever is 9mm , then the defect days for continuous data losing should be less than 11 days and for discrete data losing , the defect days should be less than 12 days .
last but not least , an advice is given that in the study of vertical crustal movement using elevation component time series of gnss cors , the operation status of gnss permanent station should be strictly screened

the geological characteristics of chang 8 reservoir in zhidan area of ordos basin is complex where relatively high resistivity water layer , relatively low resistivity oil layer coexist with conventional oil-water layer , which causes logging response variable .
they can not be identified effectively by logging parameters , resulting in &quot; missing &quot; of effective reservoirs and misrecognition of water layers .
in view of the above situation , combined with the large amount of data of logging , trial production , oil testing and coring analysis for the major oil layers of chang 81 in zhidan , focus is laid on individual logging information extraction and comprehensive application of the parameters .

acoustic logging is one of the important methods to gain formation parameters near the borehole .
however there is extreme hole enlargement condition in drilling , which influences the acoustic logging data . environmental correction is necessary .
it has been proved that the extreme hole enlargement correction algorithm can correct the influence caused by irregular hole diameter on acoustic logging data .
but some disvantages in the method expose such as taking up large space and long running time , etc . , which can not meet the need of immediate processing of logging interpretation in the working field .
through research , it is found that cuda parallel computation is suitable for large scale and repeat calculation . therefore cuda parallel algorithm is designed for acoustic wave reversion correction algorithmic .
it is realized in cuda programming platform .
comparing with serial computing in the experiments , cuda parallel computation reduces 30 % time in processing 200m interval data with accurate results .
it shows from the results and time that acoustic logging extreme hole enlargement correction algorithm fits to cuda parallel computation
quaternary loose sandstone is the principal producing formation of no. 1 gas field in sebei . there are many difficulties in calculating gas saturation and identifying fluid type because of poor diagenesis , interbedded sand and shale .
its lithology is mainly siltstone . porosity is distributed between 28 % ~ 34 % and permeability is between 10.0 ~ 100.0 md . it belongs to high-porosity and middle-permeability reservoir .
as the reservoirs are saturated by natural gas , it is difficult to ensure the accuracy of single porosity model .
the density-neutron twovariable regression porosity model is established combining with coring well .
shale content is general high in the formation which has obvious effect on permeability .
therefore the twovariable regression permeability interpretation model of relativelynatural gamma-relatively spontaneous potential is established .
according to the difficulties in calculating gas saturation , four methods are proposed after study .
compared with practical production data , the method of combining gas saturation computation with selected archie and simandoux formulae is suitable for the field , which consistency of fluid property reaches to 88.89 % . it is of great significance in guiding production in the area

climate change is a hot topic in modern society , as global warming is detected for last 100 years . intergovernment panel on climate change ( ipcc ) believed that human activities played an important role in contribution to global warming .
now people seem afraid very much on the &quot; global warming &quot; , as any natural disasters happen , no matter the disaster is flooding or drought , heat wave or cool snowing disasters , just attribute them as a result of global warming . so did ipcc 4th assessment report .
is global climate really warming ?
is global climate really so severely warming ?
does global warming bring to human just disadvantages without any benefits ?
flooding and drought are the two aspects of a pair of antinomy , how both can be caused by the same factor of &quot; global warming &quot; ?
geological records show that climatic variation is normal on the earth history . many glacial and interglacial periods , respectively corresponding for global cooling and warming , cycle long time before human appearance .
the main driving factor of global change is the amount of the earth receiving radiation from sun .
stable climate is temporarily and short terms , while various climate is long terms and everlasting .
this paper synthesizes and compares various consequences of global warming and cooling , we think that global warming brings more benefits than disadvantages to human beings

the ice nuclei ( in ) were observed in nanjing from may to august 2011 using a 5 l mixing cloud chamber and a static diffusion cloud chamber , and the characteristics of different ice nuclei concentrations were examined .
the daytime concentration of in was larger than that at night and peaked in the afternoon , which indicates that atmospheric in is significantly influenced by turbulence intensity , human activities , and industrial pollution .
the scavenging effect of precipitation on in was obvious , and the concentration of in increased during the typhoon system .
the in levels in the nanjing area increased with decreasing temperatures and increasing humidity .
the back trajectory model showed that the concentration of ice nuclei in the air mass from the northeast marine region was highest , and that the number of ice nuclei in different air masses decreased with decreasing activation temperature .
a case analysis focused on the relationship between in and pm 1 ( the particulate matter with diameter less than or equal to 1μm ) produced by biomass burning suggested that the product of the combustion may contribute to in

the variations of temperature in winter in eastern asia during 17 stratospheric weak polar vortex events were investigated based on the standardized temperature departure and the northern annular mode ( nam ) index calculated by using ncep data set .
results show that the circulation anomalies in the stratosphere occurred about 15 days before the temperature variation in the troposphere . in the latter period of the weak stratospheric polar vortex , the surface temperature departure reached its peak .
at that time , the regions south of latitude 40 ° n were warmer than the climatic average and the regions north of 40 ° n were colder .
the variation of potential vorticity and the asian trough at 500 hpa are also taken into account when discussing the physical process and mechanism of the anomalous surface temperature . in addition , cold air with high potential vorticity remains near 60 ° n in the early and middle period of the weak vortex and begins to extend southwards in the late period .
in the middle and upper troposphere , cold air from the high latitudes canmigrate to 45 ° n. at the same time , the asian trough at 500 hpa becomes stronger and the low pressure region moves eastward ;
the ridge near lake baikal becomes weaker , the activity of cold air behind the trough influences northeast china , northern china and more northerly regions and causes the surface temperature to fall .
moreover , warmer air with low potential vorticity moves from the south into the regions south of 40 ° n causing the surface temperature there to rise
warm and ice-rich frozen soil belongs to plastic frozen soil , of which the compressibility is remarkable under loading .
in order to study the compressive properties of the warm and ice-rich frozen soil , compression tests under constant temperature and stepped load were conducted at temperatures of-0.3 , -0.5 , -0.7 , -1.0 , -1.5 ℃ and with water contents of 40 % , 80 % , 120 % , respectively .
then the volume compressibility coefficients were obtained . the test results indicate that : the compressibility of the soil is considerable .
for example , the volume compressibility coefficient of the clay specimen at-0.3 ℃ with water content of 40 % could reach to 0.328 mpa-1 , which belongs to high compressibility soil .
2 ) exists in the soil during the process of compression , and mostly occurs in the initial stage of loading .
3 ) temperature and water content of the soil , which control the volumetric unfrozen water content , are the most important factors to impact the compressibility .
4 ) under the test conditions mentioned above , the compressibility of the soil increases with temperature rising and water content decreasing .
when the temperature is higher , the effect of water content on the compressibility is remarkable , but it is not obvious when the temperature is relatively low
using the objective definition and auto-identification and tracking technique , the database of extratropical cyclones ( ecs ) in the winter half-year in northern china from 1951 to 2010 is built on the basis of the ncep / ncar reanalysis data .
furthermore , the climatology and interannual variability of ecs are studied .
the results show that cyclogenesis is mainly focused in the central-west region of mongolia and the eastern foot of yablonoi mountains .
ecs are active mostly over southeast of mongolia , southeast of inner mongolia , and the songnen plain ;
however , cyclolysis and rapid decay of ecs occur over the southeast of inner mongolia and central-north of northeast china .
the frequency of ecs is the highest in early spring and middle autumn and the lowest in winter .
with seasonal evolution , the active region of ecs moves eastward and southward .
the eastward path is the most common track of ecs , after which comes the southeastward track , and then the northeastward one .
horizontal winds at 700 hpa can be considered as the steering flow of ecs .
the rapid growth of ecs , whose standard deepening rate is greater than 0.5 bergeron for 24 h , is mainly active over the east of inner mongolia , central-north of northeast china , and the central japan sea .
however , explosive ecs are spread mainly over the japan sea and marginally over the continent of china .
the extremely strong ec eventsoccurred mostly in the early spring and mid autumn before the 1980s .
however , frequency of ecs was relatively low , the frequency of extremely strong ecs has increased since the 1980s .
the decrease of ecs is related to the weakening of the baroclinicity in the lower troposphere of northeast asia
in order to study oil and gas distribution law of middle and shallow strata in nanpu depression , the method of relationship between match relation , faults transporting oil-gas and caprocks and oilgas distribution is used , to study controlling of oil-gas accumulation and distribution .
controlling of the time and space match of faults and caprocks to oil-gas accumulation and distribution of middle and shallow strata in nanpu depression are found in the following three situations : firstly , if effective thickness of ed 2 mudstone caprock is greater than 90 ~ 95m , oil-gas is mainly distributed in ed3and ed4regardless of effective thickness of ng 3 volcanic caprock .
secondly , if effective thickness of ed 2 volcanic caprock is less than 90 ~ 95mand ng 3 volcanic caprock is greater than 130 ~ 150m , oil-gas is also distributed in ed 1 and ng 4 , in addition to ed 3 and ed 4 .
thirdly , if effective thickness of ed3mudstone caprock is less than 90 ~ 95m , effective thickness of ng 3 volcanic caprock is less than 130 ~ 150mand effective thickness of nm 1 mudstone caprock is more than 90 ~ 95m , oil-gas is distributed all from top to bottom .
forming periods of sealing ability of two regional caprocks are both earlier than periods of faults transporting oil-gas , thus both can effectively seal the oil-gas transported by faults .
this is probably the crucial reason that oil-gas is relatively accumulated under two regional caprocks
in order to deal with the dynamic of bottom hole pressure and its influencing factors in the production process of shale gas reservoir , a mathematical model of shale gas reservoir with dual-porosity and dual-permeability was established . this model is based on the law of conservation of mass , considering the desorption and the pressure sensitivity . numerical model then can be obtained by means of finite differeace approach .
through the analysis of influences on the bottom hole pressure double logarithm curve which can be attributed to desorption , langmuir volume , langmuir pressure , adsorption time , pressure sensitive , it finally comes to the conclusions that the more absorbed gas in the well , the slower pressure drops , the later boundary to be touched .
the increase of langmuir volume or langmuir pressure makes the concave part of the double logarithm curve of the bottom hole pressure more obvious .
the smaller the time constant of adsorption is , the better the diffusion effects , and the easier to achieve the section of integral radial flow .
the greater the pressure sensitivity coefficient , the more obvious double logarithm curve up .
the results of the study for shale gas reservoir development has a guiding significance
freezing and thawing is an important geomorphic process of the periglacial environment . its activity is a direct reflection of climate change and thus it is an important part of the cryosphere process .
based on a long-term monitoring in the source region of the ürümqi river from 1991 to 2011 , a discussion in detail on the characteristics of sorted circles and frost heaving mechanism in the tianshan mountains is made in this article .
in the source region , the effect of frost heaving is strongest within the surface layer of 20 cm deep , while the stake of 3 cm in diameter is least affected by frost heaving . inside a sorted circle the frost heaving becomes weaker along radius from the center to the edge .
frost heaving in sorted circle area is stronger than that in the area without sorted circle .
the altitude has significant effect on frost heaving .
at the altitude range from 3 500 to 4 000 m , frost heaving enhances with altitude and reaches a maximum at 3 900 m , the equilibrium line altitude of glaciers .
correlation analysis demonstrates that the development of frost heaving and sorted circles has closely relation with moisture and thermal regime in the warm half year ( from may to october ) . frost heaving has positive relation with precipitation in the warm season , the transfer days when ground temperature undulates around 0 ℃ is also an important factor .
the sorted circle monitoring reveals that periglacial landform is sensitive to regional climate change and has an active respond to the air temperature rising in recent two decades
a regional climate model ( regcm3 ) nested in one-way mode within a nasa / ncar finite volume element agcm ( fvgcm ) is used in this study .
two sets of multi-decadal simulations are conducted at 20-km grid spacing for present day ( 1961 – 1990 ) and future climates ( 2071 – 2100 , a2 scenario ) .
the runoff outputs are used to drive a large-scale routing model ( resolution , 0.25 ° * 0.25 ° ) , to project the effect of future climate change on hydrological extreme events over the yellow river and yangtze river basins .
the results show that the annual variability of the streamflow over the yellow river will increase , and the monthly variability will decrease . the diurnal variability will decrease upstream and increase downstream of toudaoguai station .
a greater possibility of the largest streamflow percentile will exist in theupper reaches of lanzhou station in sub-humid areas and southeast of the yellow river basin in humid areas , whereas the possibility is less in the arid and semi-arid areas of the northwestern basin .
the flood disaster risk will increase in future over the middle reaches of the yellow river except in the summer season .
the annual variability of the yangtze river may increase , and the diurnal and monthly variability may decrease in the upper and middle reaches and rise slightly in the lower reaches in future .
the annual , monthly , and diurnal variability of the streamflows all increase in future over the hanjiang river basin .
the flood disaster risk may decrease over the yangtze river , especially in summer , and the probability of flooding in the hanjiang river basin will increase in each month

2 ) the qingshan stage of early cretaceous dominated by w-e extension caused by a rifting process ;
3 ) the nw-se compression stage at the end of early cretaceous due to the oblique subduction of the paleo-pacific plate under the east asian continent ;
4 ) the wangshi stage of late cretaceous dominated by n-s extension , controlled by the tethys system and the direction change of the subduction of the paleo-pacific plate ;
5 ) the stage of late paleocene dominated by ne-sw compression

in this paper , the rubidium ( rb ) and strontium ( sr ) geochemical characteristics of the typical loess sequence in the southern margin of the horqin dunefield are analyzed .
results show that the variation pattern of rb-sr in the horqin loess are similar to those of the chinese loess plateau , excepted for that the rb content is lower and the sr content is higher , probably resulted from the colder and drier climate in this study area , which led to very weak chemical weathering .
it further indicates that the variations in rb / sr ratio in the northeastern china loess sequence may represent the alternation of east asian summer and winter monsoon climates .
based on the rb-sr geochemical data , it is suggested that horqin dunefield had experienced a warmer and wetter climate in the periods of 108-144 ka 86 ± 7 ka , and 233 ± 21 ka , while it was very cold and dry , even worse than the desertification environment in the period of 262 ± 32 ka .
the climate changes in this study area are consistent with variations of the east asian monsoon during late quaternary . it could be a footprint of the global glacial-interglacial climatic variations in northeastern china
to study role of fault-sandstone matching to oil-gas accumulation based on internal structure of fault zone and its transporting , sealing oil-gas characteristics , transporting oil-gas characteristics of fault-sandstone matching and its controlling to oil-gas accumulation were studied by the method of studying space combination of fault-sandstone and analysis of actual example .
the result indicates that faultsandstone matching can be divided into two type of sandstone on hanging wall of fault and sandstone on foot wall of fault according to space relation between fault and sandstone .
fault-sandstone matching of sandstone on hanging wall of fault can be divided into three types of intersection angle between sandstone and fault more than zero , equal to zero and less than zero .
if oil-gas migration direction is different , the role of different fault-sandstone matching to oil-gas migration is different , when oil-gas migrates vertically though fault , fault-sandstone matching , whose sandstone is on hanging wall of fault and whose intersection angle between fault and sandstone is more than zero , is favorable for oil-gas to migrate from fault to sandstone .
oil-gas can accumulates on positive structure ( fault-anticline , fault-block , fault-sealing traps ) near the fault .
when oil-gas migrates laterally through sandstone , matching between cisoid fault and sandstone is favorable for oil-gas to migrate from sandstone to the fault , matching between transoid fault and sandstone if favorable for oil-gas to accumulate and to form fault-anticline , fault-block and fault-sealing oil-gas reservoirs

based on a study of the tectonic mélange between the longling-ruili fault and the main gaoligong fault with the help of geological mapping and sections , the authors found the lentoid and intermittent medium-acidic volcanic rocks , which belong to the triassic zhaduo formation and lie in longling-ruili fault .
the zircon u-pb dating age of 130.0 ± 1.7ma of the volcanic rocks was obtained . it is confirmed for the first time that there exist early cretaceous volcanic rocks in the longling-ruili fault of western yunnan province .
the geochemical characteristics of the volcanic rocks suggest that they were island arc tholeiites ( iat ) and should be the response to the closure of the nujiang ocean in the early cretaceous , related to westward subduction of bangong co-nujiang oceanic crust and eastward subduction of neo-tethys oceanic crust
gaoligong tectonic belt is located in eastern gandise block , and gaoligong granites in western yunnan constitute an important magmatic record of gandise tectonic movement .
research on the geochemical characteristics of puchuan granites in southern menglian granites of gaoligong tectonic belt suggests that these granites with strong peraluminous character can be assigned to high-k calc-alkaline granites .
ree distribution patterns show steeply right oblique feature and enrichment of lree , with weak negative eu anomaly .
puchuan granites , with post-collision characteristics , were formed in a tectonic environment of transition from major collision to post-collision and inland .
la-icp-ms u-pb dating of zircons indicates that puchuan granites were emplaced during the early cretaceous period ( 128.9 ± 2.4ma ) . geochemical and chronological data of these granites are consistent to those of granites in northern and central gaoligong tectonic belts .
based on field investigation of the depositional sedimentary characteristics of mud-rock flow deposits in 21 key trenches and their basic formation conditions in the lujiang river ( a segment of the nujiang river ) , in combination with the indoor mathematical statistics of the mud-rock flow ditch catchment area and the vertical gradient , the authors used osl to measure the age of the diluvium .
the authors hold that the development of the mud-rock flow has obvious regional and periodic characteristics .
the results obtained indicate that , with the lujiang river as the boundary , the mud-rock flow migrated from the west bank to the east bank , the east bank mud-rock flow grew differently in the north and in the south , and tended to develop from north to south with obvious phases , and the growth of the mud-rock flow can be divided into three phases

the riyueshan-hualong basic-ultrabasic rock belt has a number of well-developed intrusive bodies composed mainly of amphibole gabbro , gabbro , norite , pyroxenite , augite peridotite and peridotite , which are related to copper-nickel mineralization .
this paper reports some achievements made in evaluation of magmatic type copper-nickel ore resources potential in hualong county , qinghai province , on the basis of field survey and investigation of yulonggou intrusive body . id-tims u-pb dating of zircon from the yulonggou intrusive body yielded an age of 442.7ma ± 1.6 ma .
petrologic and geochemical characteristics and regional comparative investigation show that yulonggou intrusive body is a ferruginous series ultrabasic-basic complex characterized by good magmatic differentiation and high abundance of useful elements such as ni , cu and co , therefore favorable for mineralization .
440 ma was in the period when subduction orogeny was converted into collision orogeny in the whole qilian mountain and then into the orogenic stage with the closure of laji mountain small ocean basin , thus forming yulonggou basic-ultrabasic intrusive body in a post-collision extensional environment .
a comparison of information with other intrusive rocks in riyueshan-hualong basic-ultrabasic rock belt reveals that all the intrusive rocks might have been formed in the same period , characterized by specific dynamic mechanism and evolution process .
this extensional rifting event had a very close relationship with mineralization , so the research has very important practical significance
the heishan copper-nickel deposit is located in the rift zone of the beishan mountain northeast of the tarim plate , on the southern side of miaomiaojing-shuangyingshan fault .
the ore-bearing mafic-ultramafic complex intruded into dahuoluoshan formation of qingbaikou system and cambrian shuangyingshan formation .
mineralization mainly occurred in peridotite and hornblende-gabbro complex .
shrimp u-pb dating of zircon from the ore-bearing hornblende-gabbro body yieldes an age of 374.6 ma ± 5.2ma , which suggests that the intrusion of the ore-bearing complex and the mineralization both occurred in late devonian .
the obtaining of this age has important significance in understanding geological evolution of beishan mountain area and also in indicating targets for copper-nickel ore prospecting in beishan mountain area
gongyanghe group , which was named in 1965 , is composed of epimetamorphic sandstone and shale interlayered with small amounts of siliceous rock ( or siliceous shale ) and limestone and represents a set of turbid flow and bathyal facies sediments with flyschoid rhythm and rare organisms .
its age has been generally considered to be between sinian and middle cambrian , which , however , is not based on the evidence of fossils or accurate dating .
in this study , the authors identified the stratigraphic sequence composed of several layers of metamorphic basic volcanic rock in bangmai village of longling county .
it is held that its original rock was basalt formed in an intra-continental tension environment and probably related to extension after the pan-african orogenic period .
the authors got for the first time the u-pb age ( 499.2ma ± 2.1ma ) of zircon from metamorphic basic volcanic rock and thus provided a reliable chronological basis for the division of the gongyanghe group and the restriction of the age .
this achievement is very important for the further study of the tectonic characteristics and history of the deformed metamorphic belt of the gaoligong mountain

geological and geomorphic evidence for active faulting shows that the activity of the east piedmont fault of the diancang mountain , the baoshan fault zone , the pupiao-shidian fault , and the wanding fault zone were evidently more stronger than other active faults during late quaternary .
based on the historic and instrumental earthquake data and study results of active faults , the authors drew a new seismic intensity map for the area of the dali-ruili railway .
the new earthquake intensity map shows that there are at least five high seismic intensity ( intensity ≥ ⅸ ) areas along the dali-ruili railway . these areas include dali-midu , baoshan , pupiao-shidian , zhen ′ an-jingzhuping and wanding-ruili from northeast to southwest

narigongma biotite granite porphyry in northern sanjiang region is an important porphyry type copper-molybdenum mineralization belt in qinghai province , and the narigongma copper-molybdenum deposit is an intrusion-related porphyry type ore deposit recently discovered in northern sanjiang region .
the authors obtained the zircon u-pb age of 41.53 ± 0.24ma for narigongma biotite granite porphyry , which should belong to early himalayan period .
the main metallogenic age is between 40.86 and 40.8 ma .
in multi-phase hydrothermal superimposition and mineralization , the hydrothermal solution of the narigongma porphyry copper-molybdenum deposit must have been derived from biotite granitite porphyry of 41.53 ± 0.24 ma and plagioclase granite porphyry of 41.0 ± 0.18ma.
in virtue of existence of many intermediate-acid intrusive rocks , the age determination of these intrusive is not only of theoretical importance but also of practical significance in search for porphyry type copper-molybdenum deposits of the same epoch

the kaerqueka copper-polymetallic ore bodied in qimantage region can mainly be found in monzonitic granite and skarn belts located in the contact zones between granodiorite , porphyritic biotitic monzogranite and cambrian-ordovician strata .
based on la-icp-ms u-pb chronological study of zircons , the authors obtained the age ( 410.1ma ± 2.6ma ) of biotitic monzogranite close to ⅶ ore belt .
nevertheless , other researchers hold that the rock-forming and ore-forming processes took place in indo-chinese period based on the age of granodiorite ( 237ma ± 2ma ) and the re-os model age ( 239ma ) of molybdenite .
a comparison of the geochemical characteristics between the two rock bodies has led the authors to reach the conclusion that the mineralization was related not only to the indo-chinese intermediate-acid intrusive rocks but also to the late caledonian acid intrusive rocks , and there existed a difference in magma origin between porphyritic biotitic monzogranite and granodiorite , suggesting that they were formed in different periods of tectonic evolution .
ore deposits in qimantag region were formed in late caledonian and in indo-chinese period .
although the outcrop of late caledonian period is not so apparent as the one of indo-chinese period , due attention should be paid to the contribution of late caledonian intrusives to mineralization
the xiaohulishan molybdenum deposit is a medium-size concealed porphyry molybdenum deposit recently discovered in beishan area , inner mongolia .
the authors studied isotopes of the ore-bearing porphyries and the quartz vein type molybdenum deposit in late mineralization stage , and obtained the zircon la-icp-ms u-pb age of 216.9ma ± 0.5ma ( mswd = 0.41 ) for xiaohulishan porphyry granite , which is close to the re-os model age of 213.2ma ± 4.6ma ( mswd = 1.3 ) for molybdenite , thus providing isotope age evidence for porphyry genesis of the xiaohulishan molybdenum deposit .
the molybdenite re-os isotope age in late metallogenic stage is 213.2ma ± 4.6ma ( mswd = 1.3 ) .
the ore-forming porphyry of the xiaohulishan mo deposit was distributed along the heihe river which was controlled by nee-trending faults that cut the early nw-trending regional structure , implying that 216-220ma was the age restriction for the evolution of the post-collision stage to the intraplate extension stage in beishan area . importance should be attached to mineralization in indosinian period in beishan area

detecting underground geological structures is one of the key considerations for such work as engineering geology , hydrology and geothermic survey by using geophysical prospecting methods .
generally the anomalies of radon measurement directly determine the attributes of underground geological structures , but without penetrating depth information .
csamt , though incapable of attributes identification , has high resolution in exploring the positions , widths and attitudes of geological structures .
two practical examples show that combined exploration analysis can solve such problems as intruding contact of the granite body , fault contact between limestone in the anticline center and clastic rocks in anticline limbs and can also explore geological conditions controlling thermal springs developed on the boundary between soluble and non-soluble rocks .
all these data can be used to evaluate engineering geological disasters , analyze geothermal formation and provide detailed information of underground geological structures
the xinjiang-gansu-inner mongolia juncture area is divided into two parts , i. e . , xingxingxia-hanshan micro-plant and dunhuang micro-plant , and the suture line between them is hongliuhe-niujuanzi-xichangjing ophiolite belt .
in cambrian , the shallow marine basin of old landmass was divergent frequently , and sedimentary deposits could be formed , such as phosphorus-vanadium-uranium-manganese mineral resources .
in ordovician ocean basin and back-arc basin , volcano-sedimentary type copper-zinc minerals could be formed , and silurian-devonian island-arc volcanic formation might serve as host rock of porphyry copper deposits .
the volcano-sedimentary type iron deposits probably occurred in carboniferous-permian continental rift sedimentary formation , and porphyry copper deposits and copper-nickel deposits of basic rock type could be formed .
the palaeocontinunt crust melting type granite mass constituted favorable background for the formation of metallogenic w , sn and rare metal deposits
there are complex structures of aquifer and numerous hot springs in luxi basin .
the authors carried out geological , hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical survey of two typical hot springs ( the fapa hot spring and mangliu hot spring ) to probe into the doubtful points in the analysis of the hot springs , and made a comparison with hot springs formed under different conditions .
on such a basis , the genesis of the hot springs was further analyzed .
the results show that the fapa hot spring and mangliu hot spring are typical fault hot springs , their sources should be precipitation and endogenous high-temperature fluids , and the heat-storing layer is composed of dolomite and dolomitic limestone of the permian shazipo formation jurassic and mengga formation . it is estimated that the thermal energy storage temperature could reach 160 ℃ at the depth of 2000m
in beishan area , the suture zone or ophiolite belt that represents the dividing of ocean-continent tectonic plate is nonexistent , and the main body is composed of east tianshan and tarim old land systems .
their collision boundary is generally located along fangshankou-heishan-jianquanzi line ; the area north of this line belongs to dongtianshan old land system , and that south of this line is assigned to tarim old land system .
according to stratigraphic age , sedimentary formation , magmatism and crustal structure , the dongtianshan old land system is divided into three second-grade tectonic units from north to south , i .
, beishan island arc belt , late paleozoic back-arc rift zone and fault-uplift zone of central old land .
they spatially make up an ocean-continent transitional framework of island arc-back-arc basin-foreland basement .
the southern tarim old land system experienced the evolution from the original continental nucleus to mature continental crust .
based on characteristics of crustal structure and tectonism , the authors also divided this old land system into three second-grade tectonic units from north to south , namely early paleozoic depression zone of tarim old land margin , hongliuyuan-daqishan-tiancang paleozoic multicyclic rift zone and tarim old land basement .
besides , the metallogenic series of different tectonic units are summarized in this paper
according to meteorological data in beijing area , the deciles index ( deciles ) , standard precipitation index ( spi ) , reconnaissance drought index ( rdist ) in monthly , seasonal and yearly scale are compared .
and the meteorological data during 1958-2008 is used to study three indexes relationship .
the indexes are applied to analyze the effect of continuous drought during 1999-2007 .
the results show that spi and rdist have good correlation ; rdist considers the influence of evaporation on drought and it reflects actual situation very well with stable results ; however , the rdist is better than spi.deciles is sensitive to precipitation .
deciles in monthly and seasonal scale is not suitable for application to beijing area , but deciles in yearly scale can better reflect the serious extent of drought process in historical series
for the purpose of calculating the uplifting range of the western yunnan plateau , zhongdian , baoshan , jinggu and jingdong were selected to study the neogene coal rock .

mengmao monzogranite , exposed in longling area of western yunnan , was geochemically analyzed and discussed to probe into its genesis , ore-forming material source and tectonic setting .
the results show that mengmao granite has high sio2 ( 72.17 % ~ 76.45 % ) and al2o3 , with a / cnk ratios ranging between 0.86 and 1.45 ( 1.12 on average ) . these data suggest that mengmao granite belongs to typical peraluminous granite , with over-saturated si and al .
the ∑ ree values range from 138.17 * 10-6 to 383.68 * 10-6 , and the ree patterns show right oblique feature and obvious negative eu anomaly .
trace elements show enrichment of lile ( large-ion lithophile elements ) such as k , sr , rb and ba and depletion of hfse ( high field strength elements ) such as zr , ta , nb and th .
magmatic source was typical of crustal genesis and was probably formed by rising and emplacement of granitic magma , which had been partially melted by greywacke .
la-icp-ms u-pb dating of zircons indicates that mengmao granite was emplaced during the middle ordovician ( 454.7 ± 1.5ma ) , with post-collisional magmatic activity features .
mengmao granite , as post-collisional granite and a product of magmatism by late gondwana land orogenic movement , was formed in the tectonic transition stage from syn-collision ( extrusion environment ) to post-collision ( stretching environment ) .
the result of the researches on mengmao monzogranite has significance in revealing tectonic attributes of nujiang fault belt in western yunnan
in this paper , pliocene ages ( ca . 2.8 ma ) of trachyandesite and trachyte from longchuanjiang valley in tengchong area were yielded using shrimp ⅱ in beijing shrimp laboratory .
the ages of trachyandesite and trachyte correspond with each other within uncertainties and are taken to represent the time of eruption ( 2.81 ma ± 0.11 ma ) .
the volcanic rocks are rich in alkalis ( na2o = 3.53-3.66 wt % , k2o = 3.33-3.64 wt % ) and calcium ( cao = 4.04-5.05 wt % ) .
they contain high ba ( 1057 * 10-6 ~ 1145 * 10-6 ) , sr ( 502.0 * 10-6 ~ 650.7 * 10-6 ) , ree ( σree = 315.53 * 10-6 ~ 365.16 * 10-6 ) , and zr ( 308.8 * 10-6 ~ 382.2 * 10-6 ) . these geochemical features are different from those of typical island arc volcanic rocks but show an affinity with contaminated asthenosphere-generated continental basaltic rocks .
the pliocene volcanic rocks from longchuanjiang valley in tengchong area were derived from partial melting of an enriched mantle source , contaminated by large crustal materials in an intraplate extensional environment
shrimp u-pb dating of zircons from two representative samples of the batholith shows that the crystallization age is 473.5 ± 2.9ma and 461.5 ± 7.3ma respectively .
petrochemical and geochemical analyses show that the granite is high-silica ( sio2 = 71.06 % -73.88 % ) , high-aluminous ( al2o3 = 13.03 % -14.27 % ) , high-k ( k2o = 2.81 % -5.53 % ) , low-ca ( cao = 0.67 % -1.71 % ) and peraluminous ( asi = 1.4-1.8 ) .
there is an evident negative eu anomaly ( δeu = 0.19-0.47 ) in its ree patterns .
in the diagrams of trace element patterns , there are very high peaks of rb and th and strong depletion of ba .
as for the sm and nd isotopes , 143nd / 144nd ratio is 0.512022 and 0.512056 respectively .
the above data show that the magma of the granite was derived mainly from the melting of the upper crust . the authors have come to the conclusion that the emplacement and crystallization of the granite batholith had a close relationship with the collisional orogeny and crustal thickening and were also closely related to the crustal partial melting in the late period of the pan-african orogeny
the dali-ruili railway is an important part of the south line of the fanya railway .
in order to solve the complex geological problems in railway building , china geological survey carried out 1 ∶ 50000 regional geological mapping and environment hazard investigation from january 2008 to december 2010 .

luxi tectonic melange belt was discovered , which is thought to be a part of the nujiang tectonic melange belt
during the field work , the authors discovered that along the daojie-huitongqiao segment of the nujiang river there are not only multiple low terraces less than 150m above the river level but also multiple high terraces as well as dammed-lake sediments and their underlying gravels between 180 and 380m above the river level .
these high terraces consist of thick bedded alluvial gravels , which are rounded and have complex composition , the dammed-lake sediments consist of sand and are nearly 100m thick , and the underlying sediments consist of alluvial gravels and are about 100m thick .
the isotope dating shows that 6 low terraces should be formed since the middle pleistocene .
the magneto-stratigraphic study of the wangjianglou section shows that the upper lacustrine sand beds corresponding in composition to the upper part of the 9th terrace are dominated by positive polarity but include two short periods of negative polarity , whereas the lower lacustrine sand beds are of negative polarity .
according to their correlation with the standard magneto-stratigraphic column , these lacustrine beds should have been formed during the middle-late pliocene , i .
,4.2-2.6mabp , whereas their underlying buried terraces and higher terraces might have been formed during the early pliocene-late miocene .
the regional stratigraphic correlation made on the basis of this deduction suggests that , while the tibetan plateau began rising in the middle-late miocene , the nujiang river probably began its life as a river .
it has long been in a downcutting state . by the early pliocene , it had downcut into a place below its present river bed
through investigation of the characteristics of the malanghe debris flow on the east bank of the nujiang river in baoshan city , yunnan province , and determination of the age of the diluvium by osl , this paper holds that the debris flow gully is young and dangerous .

in this paper , seven factors were chosen as the main relevant factors . the evaluation result is the same as that of the field investigation , and the fatalness is in the degree of moderate risk ( ⅲ ) .
two key points in the evaluation process are pointed out in this paper , i. e . , the establishment of the weight sets and the determination of the degree of membership .
the first point is achieved and optimized by minimizing the distance summation between &quot; ideal points &quot; ; and the second is implemented through the membership function designed on the basis of the half trapezoid distribution model .
repeated experiments have confirmed that this method is workable and more practical than other methods
the available hot-spring data show that the geothermal field along the dali-ruili railway in western yunnan province has different subareas . the authors studied the distribution characteristics of igneous rocks , active faults , earthquakes in history and other related geophysical fields , such as mt and p wave velocity in the crust in this area .
the results show that the distribution of the middle / high geothermal subareas is spatially well consistent with that of the igneous rocks and the active fault system .
it is also concluded that there are three types of hot springs based on the caloric origin in this area , i. e . , magma type , deep circle through deep-cut fault type and magma-deep circle type .
studies also show that there is spatial correlation between the distribution of the hot springs and that of the earthquakes in history .
an integrated analysis of all the data obtained has led the authors to believe that the geo-thermal field in this area can act as an index for the estimation of the geo-engineering stability

under a2 and b2 scenarios , annual average runoff in source region of the yellow river appears decreasing trend ;
runoff distribution appears decreasing trend in summer and autumn ;
however , the change trend of runoff is more sensitivity to the hydrological model during winter and spring ;
the high discharge event will undergo decreasing trend and the strength of flood would fall ; the probability of low flow frequency events would increase in winter
in study of watershed clustering , choosing too many watershed characteristic indexes may increase computational complexity and overlapped information can lead to the distorted results .

the similar watershed is found out by taking the score of the principal component on the watershed as new clustering sample , which achieves parameters transplantation of data gap area .
the instance results show that the proposed method is feasible and effective

a 3-d high-resolution hydrodynamic model was established by using an unstructured grid , finite-volume coastal ocean model ( fvcom ) to study the tides and tidal currents in the lianzhou bay and adjacent areas .
the simulation results were in good agreement with in situ data . the co-tidal maps of k1 , o1 , and m2 indicated that k1 and o1 were mostly standing waves outside the lianzhou bay while m2 had a largely propagating character .
however , all three constituents turned to propagating waves when going into the lianzhou bay due to the shallow waters . the tidal current ellipses were plotted to describe the characters of k1 , o1 , and m2 constituents .
it was shown that k1 and o1 were rotating outside the bay but rectilinear along the water channels inside the bay ;
and m2 had a mostly rectilinear character over the whole area .
the residual tidal current showed that the flow was divided into two branches by guantouling peninsula . one of them turned to flow westward , and the other was blocked at the south of the peninsula to be a clockwise circulation .
in the lianzhou bay , there were two circulation systems , the cyclonic one at the mouth of the bay and the anti-cyclonic one at the top

two model slopes composed of different lithology combinations with high strength materials overlying low strength materials and low strength materials overlying high strength materials , are designed to conduct a shaking table test with the geometric scale of 1 : 100 .
the effect of seismic parameters on horizontal acceleration responses of two model slopes has been analyzed in detail .
results show that : ( 1 ) when in horizontal input motion only , the topographic amplification effects under sine waves of 15 hz vibration frequency and real waves only occur in the middle to the top part of models .
moreover , the response rules resemble each other in the model with low strength materials overlying high strength materials due to the similar dominant frequencies .
( 2 ) under real waves , the effects under complex direction excitation are basically stronger than those in horizontal motion only and vertical motion only in sequence , and response rules under the first two conditions are similar in curve shape .
( 3 ) as input intensity increases , the amplification effects are strengthened in the lower frequencies .
( 4 ) under the complex direction excitation of real waves , the peak horizontal accelerations at each elevation demonstrate increase tendency , while their corresponding amplification factors decrease gradually in the upper part of models until the values keep stable bellow 2.0 , indicating the decay of the topographic effect .
in addition , effects of seismic parameters on horizontal acceleration responses of model slopes vary with the lithology combination , and as input intensity increases , the effects on the model with high strength materials overlying low strength materials are 1.0 ~ 2.7 times stronger than those on the model with low strength materials overlying high strength materials in the middle to the top part
thirty four cases of topical cyclogenesis that occurred in boreal winter ( november to february of next year ) during 12-yr ( 1995-2006 ) have been analyzed by using the composite technique for further understanding of the larger-scale circulation features and the mechanism of the formation of tropical cyclone in the western north pacific ( wnp ) during wintertime .
it has been found that the easterly waves play a major role in the tropical cyclogenesis . the existence of low-level cross-equatorial tropical cyclone pairs is a remarkable feature in the formation of tropical cyclogenesis .
the equatorial mixed rossby-gravity ( mrg ) waves in lower troposphere propagated northwestward from the central pacific . these waves developed into the td-type disturbances in place where the strong convection overlaps , which provided disturbances for the tropical cyclogenesis .
further analysis in terms of eddy kinetic energy budgets for the tc ( tropical cyclone ) related with circulations indicates that the available potential energy of disturbances and the energy that converts barotropically from the mean kinetic energy facilitates the tc formation .
these two kinds of energy are associated with cumulus convection heating and the asymmetric horizontal flow respectively .
the barotropic energy conversion mainly occurs in the low and mid-troposphere while the available energy conversion locates in the mid and upper troposphere .
the tropic easterly waves get barotropic instability energy from the mean flow and coupled with the deep convection , inducing the formation of tcs under the interaction of dynamics and thermodynamics

using observed data sets from 1979 to 2010 , the influence of different spatial e1 nino types on the summer precipitation over the reaches of changjiang-huaihe rivers is investigated .
results show that during the summer of the typical e1 nino , the anomalous precipitation is above the climate mean state in the east but below it in the west , while the anomalous precipitation is below the climate mean state all over the region during e1 nino modoki .
this spatial distribution is almost consistent with the mode of the svd analysis for the precipitation and the tropical sea surface temperature .

the impacts of different sea surface temperature ( sst ) on intensity change in tropical cyclone goni ( 0907 ) are investigated using 84-hour wrf model simulation .
results show that the 4-km wrf model reproduces reasonably well the erratic track and reintensification of goni when it enters beibu gulf .
goni &apos;s intensity is very sensitive to the sst but the track is not when it enters sea , and the high sst of beibu gulf is one of the key factors for goni &apos;s reintensification .
after increasing ( reducing ) the model &apos;s sst , the low-level heat flux will enhance ( weaken ) in the southwest of the center , the surface wind speed will also strengthen ( decrease ) with it .
as a result , the boundary-layer inflow and ascending movement will intensify ( reduce ) , promoting ( restraining ) the convection near the tc center ( especially at southwest ) , finally resulting in the reintensification when goni re-enters the sea

based on a current fog detection theory , a multichannel threshold method for modis data was proposed to detect daytime fog in the south china sea .
it used band 1 , band 2 , band 18 , band 20 and band 31 of modis data to separate fog from clouds and the sea surface .
if rb1 〈 20 % , rb2 〈 20 % and rbi 〉 rb2 , the pixel was identified to be the sea surface .
if rb1 〉 55 % , rb2 〉 55 % and tb31 〈 273 k , the pixel was identified to be a middle- and high-level cloud .
iflfc 〉 20 , the pixel was classified to be sea fog .
the method was verified by the sea fog observation data from guangdong coastal region .
seven out of ten samples of satellite monitoring results were consistent with the observations , three were identified to be low-level clouds according to the satellite monitoring but fog according to the observations , and only one sample was identified to be ocean surface by the satellite monitoring but fog by the observations .
because the modis data cannot penetrate the cloud or fog , the model was designed for a single-view scene which had only one layer of cloud or fog . it can accurately distinguish fog which is not covered by clouds , but it identified fog as cloud if the former is covered by a cloud . generally speaking , the model is effective and feasible

awulale mountians , located in yili terrane in north xinjiang , is an important part of central asian orogenic belt .
this paper focuses on the major , trace elements and isotope geochemistry characteristic of the permain potassic mafic volcanic rocks , which are widely distributed in the western part of the awulale mountains ( qiongbulake , kachakerang and tobasisayi ) .
we propose that : ( 1 ) the mafic volcanic rocks in the western part of awulale mountains are shoshonite . the potassic mafic volcanic rocks experienced a considerable degree of differentiation and evolution with iron magnesium index ranging from 23.3 to 64.1 .
( 2 ) element geochemistry shows that , the lower permian potassic mafic volcanic rocks formed in post-collisional arc environment in the western part of the awulale mountains .
these suggest that the geodynamic regime of this region changed from compression to extension in the early permian .
tracce element patterns as well as la / yb and nb / y ratios show significant enrichment in large ion lithophile elements and depletion in high field elements , e .
, nb , ta , ti , suggesting strong influence from plate subduction .
this studies also show , awulale potassic mafic volcanic source region also contains a certain amount of hydrous minerals amphibole or phlogopite , in addition to spinel , pyroxene , olivine , and a small amount of garnet , i .
, primitive magmas formed in spinel peridotite and garnet peridotite transition zone at depths greater than 70 km .
the tss in type b mostly generate over the middle part of the bay , accounting for 56.6 % ( 74 ) of all tss over the bay .

we analyze the convection activities and the wind field at the upper troposphere over the south china sea ( scs ) from 2006 to 2010 using the satellite data including visible images , temperature of brightness blackbody ( tbb ) , atmospheric motional vector ( amv ) and outgoing long wave radiation ( olr ) .
the region ( 110 - 120 ° e , 5 - 20 ° n ) is chosen as the satellite monitoring area for the scs summer monsoon .
it shows that , before the scs summer monsoon onset , the convection system becomes active firstly over the south-east of the bay of bengal and the indochina peninsula in most years and then spreads westward and eastward .
the scs summer monsoon onsets firstly in the south of the scs in most years and in the north of it in some years .
through comparisons it is found that the regional ( 110 - 120 ° e , 5 - 20 ° n ) average of tbb less than 273 k is consistent with the olr less than 230 w / mz , but the date when this regional average tbb less than 273 k happens is later than that for the summer monsoon onset and the tbb is larger than 273 k for many times during the summer monsoon season .
the average ( 110 -120 ° e ) tbb can describe the scs summer monsoon onset process better . the analysis also shows that when the regional average of amvs at the upper troposphere , which is derived from the ir3 channel , changes from westerlies to easterlies , the scs summer monsoon onset is well indicted .
this provides a new method for the scs summer monsoon monitoring using the fy-2 satellite data
therefore , the simulations of the early ten days ( from june 11 to 20 in 2011 ) are applied to investigate the difference of simulated experiments between the w-nur and the w-ucm through estimating the essential factors of six meteorological stations over pearl river delta metropolitan area .
the assessment results indicate that wind speeds simulated by both the w-nur and the w-ucm at 2 m height are stronger than the observed but the mean bias is reduced using the w-ucm ( 1.61 m / s for the w-nur versus 1.58 m / s for the w-ucm ) .
comparisons of the mean biases and correlation coefficients of wind speed , temperature and the dew-point temperature between the simulation and the observation show that the mean biases and the correlation coefficients of the 2 m temperature are the smallest and largest of the three elements , respectively , while those of the wind speed are the largest and smallest , respectively .
overall , although the forecast of surface elements is much improved after using the wrf coupled with the urban canopy model , the simulated wind speed at 10 m height is stronger than the observed .
for the simulation of heavy precipitation on june 21 , a strong northward wind induces a shear line to move southward , which is one of the reasons resulting in the simulated precipitation area shifting southward

the groundwater is usually injected into aquifers through pressure recharge in groundwater source heat pump system . dur- ing the pressure-increasing process , a mass of gases enter into recharge layer with the recharge water .

in this paper , the impact degree of gas clogging on recharge is quantized through pressure recharge experiment and the solving methods are proposed
in this paper , first , the relationship between the dynamic response of the deepwater riser and the significant wave height is deduced under a linear assumption , and a correction is further made to allow for nonlinearity .
then , the dynamic response of the riser is obtained by employing the time-domain scaling method , based on which a global fatigue analysis is performed .
finally , the results are compared with those obtained by the accurate calculation method . it is shown that ( 1 ) the power-law scaling approach achieves a fatigue life more acceptable in industry while the linear scaling approach is more conservative ;
( 2 ) the proposed method takes into consideration the system nonlinearity implicitly and helps to obtain accurate results with less computational effort , so that it is suitable for the initial assessment of riser fatigue and the sensitivity analysis of predicted fatigue life to key input parameters ;
and ( 3 ) the proposed method is also suitable for the fatigue evaluation due to its conservatism guaranteed by the scaling from large to small significant wave heights
based on the routine observation data , ncep reanalysis data and satellite cloud photographs , a torrential rain event causing a flood in the north of liangshan prefecture on aug. 30th to 31st , 2012 is analyzed for finding out the development mechanism of torrential rain of the mountain area in the southwest of sichuan province .
the results indicates that : due to the shear line between two high pressures and southwest low level jet , the torrential rain event occurs in a background of favorable circulation .
the torrential rainfall area locates in the south of the energy front where instability energy is rich in middle and low level .
the dynamic conditions are provided by significantly increased relative vorticity in vertical direction , and the configuration of convergence at low level and divergence at upper level .
the obvious increment of water vapor flux and intense water vapor convergence form the significant heavy rainfall conditions .
the mcs that lasts for a long time and is almost motionless causes the rain storm weather directly .
mesoscale convergence line at surface layer is a critical factor to trigger strong convection
wind is a major motivation factor for vapor transfer , and also an important factor for the rainfall numerical prediction .
to avoid the regular observation shortages of low wind resolution , long data-get time , deficient reflection for mesco-and small-scale changes in wind , and the limits of regular data in numerical prediction , the effect of a single-point and high-resolution wind data to the initial and prediction field is analyzed by assimilating profiler data .
the results show that the profiler data is workable in wrf , and assimilating wind profiler data can optimize obviously the initial field ( wind and humidity ) on the radar station , improve the flow field near the station .
thus the forecasting results of precipitation and heavy rainfall center are closer to the reality . it works well on the leeward of the profiler especially , and in other directions the closer to radar the better predictive results .
the vorticity divergence distribution and water-vapor transport field are also improved

the results show that the process was composed of radiation and advection fog .
it is also shown by the sounding data that the atmospheric stratiform during the fog was convectively stable or mildly unstable while a significant inversion existed in the layer near the surface .
at 850 hpa , a southwesterly airflow over the coastal part of south china supplied the fog with abundant amount of water vapor .
together with the intrusion of moderate cold air over the surface , the low-level atmosphere was made mildly unstable and the underlying surface was kept at relatively cold temperatures without complete destruction of the near-surface-level inversion .
under the condition of deep inversion and with the transportation of warm and humid airflow by the low-level southwest branch of the westerlies and the convergence of adequate amount of water vapor , condensation resulted , maintaining the heavy fog and light rain over eastern guangdong .
persistent and powerful warm and humid airflows were also responsible for the long duration of fog and rain in south china .
towards the end of the foggy weather , cold air became stronger and destroyed the atmospheric stratification and the conditions for the inversion to exist , dissipating the fog .
it is drawn that fog and rain will appear when δθse850 ~ 1 000 &lt; 0

it is unfavorable to use electrical methods to detect underground karst characteristics in the shallow covered karst areas owing to the field limitation and high electromagnetic interference .
it is recommended that the seismic longitudinal wave velocities tomography and transverse wave velocities profile could be used to explore the bedrock relief , geological structure and karst development .
it is not difficult to get the seismic records by using the two methods in the field while keeping the spacing unchanged within a single array .
the results show that the refraction microtremor method with multichannel noise records is of higher resolution but only for small prospecting depth in detecting bedrock relief , however , the longitudinal velocity tomography with multichannel shots is favorable in penetrating a bigger depth with the tendency of smoothing bedrock surface .
it is confirmed by borehole data that the low longitudinal velocity zone within high velocity indicates the karst area with rich fissures in bedrock , which is the good target to find underground water .
it is guaranteed that both the multichannel records and the covering with the high shot-geophone ray density can gain the reliable longitudinal wave velocities .
the combination of the two methods has some superiority to detect underground karst features

in addition , in order to reduce of the effect of the high energy noise on correlation operation , uses the median filtering and smoothing filtering technology on the reflection events curve filtering are used to further reduce residual waves effects and related operational correction error .
these methods will be integrated in the actual survey data processing of sea , large wind wave and swell under the influence of the wavy reflecting events become continuous and smooth , and under the sea clutter reflective layer it becomes clear and continuous , section signal-to-noise ratio and resolution are greatly improved
based on 3d high-resolution seismic data , a series of the high-amplitude reflections ( hars ) were discovered in meishan formation in deepwater areas of the southern qiongdongnan basin using an isometric variance slice technique .
the detailed observation of these hars revealed that the generally e-w oriented hars have variable scales , being 2-15 km in length and 500-5 000m in width .
small-scale faults are well developed within the hars .
furthermore , the hars show various features in different parts of the study area , for instance , they come in an irregular spotted shape in the east but stripped shape in the west .
in sections perpendicular to the strike , the hars are generally v-shaped or u-shaped by appearances and develop mainly on the uplifted meishan formation , beneath which there often exist buried faults formed during the rift-subsidence stage and having a strike consistent with the extension of terminal oligocene faults .
therefore , the origin of hars was attributed to the fault activation after the rifting of the basin , which resulted in an upward migration of fluids from underlying paleogene strata , a water-rock interaction of deep fluids along the fault system developed within meishan formation , and probably a fluid charge thereafter .
the discovery of the hars in the study area is of directive importance in hydrocarbon exploration in deepwater areas of qiongdongnan basin
the yulekenhalasu porphyry copper- ( molybdenum ) deposit occurs in the diorite porphyry , porphyroid quartz monzonite , and volcanic rocks of the beitashan formation .
mineralization occurs as veinlet , veinlet- disseminated and stockwork .
the ore-forming processes can be divided into three mineralization periods : porphyry , shear deformation and supergene .
the ductile shear zones are well developed in the yulekenhalasu ore district , and the strata of the middle devonian beitashan formation and lower carboniferous jiangbasitao formation , intrusives and orebodies .
the shearing related muscovite and biotite occurred in the shear surface .
40ar / 39ar dating was performed on the muscovite and biotite , which yielded two plateau ages of 283.8 ± 1.5 ma and 277.0 ± 2.0 ma , and isochron ages of 285.4 ± 3.1 ma and 277.0 ± 4.0 ma , respectively .
two plateau ages are coincident with the isochron ages within error , which reflect the ductile shearing deformation in the ore district took place in the early permian ( 284 ~ 277 ma ) . the ductile shearing deformation age in the yulekenhalasu ore deposit is coincident with the age of irtysh-mayinebo fault belt .
the porphyry cu- ( mo ) mineralization took place in the middle devonian ( 374 ma ) , while the ductile shearing deformation in the early permian reformed the cu- ( mo ) ore deposit
by analyzing features of numerous structures in the zhangji coalmine , huainan area , the interlayer-gliding structures are classified into two basic types : the corrugation type and fracture type .
according to the assemblages of the two types of interlayer-gliding structures , they can be further subdivided into domino-style , graben-and-horst , step-fault , &quot; y &quot; and &quot; anti-y &quot; structures .
experimental modeling is employed to investigate the mechanism ( s ) of the different types of interlayer-gliding structures .
the vitrinite reflectance anisotropy data revealed at least two stages of tectonic stress since mesozoic in the zhangji coalmine . the experimental modeling indicates that the nww-see direction extensional stress was probably the main dynamic factor controlling the geometry of the interlayer-gliding structures in the zhangji coalmine
as the boundary of the gaoyou sag , the zhenwu and wubao fault belts show complicated geometry and evolution history .
based on 3d seismic interpretation and calculation of mean fault active rate , we analyze the geometric and kinematic characteristics of the two fault belts during late cretaceous-quaternary and establish the temporal-spatial relationship of development of the main faults as a whole .
we also investigate the development patterns and the formation processes of the two fault belts respectively .
our results show that the main boundary faults of the gaoyou sag were formed during the deposition of the funing and dainan formations and might have been related to the nw-trending subduction of the paleo-pacific plate , which caused the nw-se trending regional extension in east china .
in particular , the trends and the formation patterns of the zhen ② 、 wu ② and ji3 faults are related to the boundary conditions . we also infer that the zhenwu and wubao fault belts are formed through different mechanism . the zhenwu fault belt was formed by stretching while the wubao fault belt was formed via an oblique slip mechanism which maybe related to the dextral strike-slip of the tanlu fault .
the dextral strike-slip of the tanlu fault maybe connected with the regional ew-trending compression induced by orthogonal subduction of the paleo-pacific plate
base on field survey and ore-forming structure analysis for the silongduo lead-zinc deposit , the structural controls and tectonic geochemical prospecting of the orefield are discussed .
the regional ew-trending compressed zones are the major rock-and ore-controlling structures , and their intersections with the transverse and oblique ruptures are the favorable ore-bearing positions .
the occurrence of the lead-zinc ore body was controlled obviously by lithology .
the upper carboniferous dolomitic limestone and dolomite of the anjie group are the favorable host rocks .
the lead-zinc ore body is usually located in the contacts between the small granite-porphyry bodies and carbonate rocks .
the concentrations of elements such as pb , zn , mn , as , sb , mo , cu , bi , sn in the rocks from the orefield are high with variable coefficients of variation , and thus can be regarded as indicator elements for ore prospecting .
the distribution patterns of the ore metals , e. g . , pb , zn , ag , mn , show characteristics of bimodal distribution , indicatve of the involvement of mineralization .
the texture and the element association of the ores show that the ore-forming processes are of multi-period and multi-stage .
the study on the element zonation and primary halo show a downwards zonation of ( cr-w-co-v-ni ) → ( ti-ba ) → ( pb-ag-au-as-sb-cu-bi ) → ( sr-zn-mn-mo-sn ) .
the zonation of elements such as as , sb are overlying the main ore body . combining with the analysis of ore-control structure in the orefield , we speculate that there is a concealed ore body at the depth of the mining area
the baishan molybdenum deposit is located in the sanchakou-baishan porphyry copper molybdenum ore belt , which belongs to the southeast edge of circum zhungaer porphyry ore belt .
this deposit occurs in the exo contact zone of the granite , which consists of biotite felsic hornfels originated from the early carboniferous gandun formation .
the orebodies occur as veins , lens and layers , 100 ~ 3000 m long , 2 ~ 38.4 m thick , with average mo grade of 0.03 % ~ 0.78 % .
ore metals consist of mainly molybdenum with accompanying copper , silver , and rhenium .
currently the proven metal mo reserve is 0.3 m tons .
based on geological , geophysical and geochemical exploration information , the neighboring areas in the south , west and east parts of the current ore zone is promising for further mineral prospecting
the volcanic rocks in the chenxing area ( hainan island ) , interlayered with paleozoic siliticlastics , experienced greenschist- and amphibolite-facies metamorphism .
these volcanic rocks are andesitic with sio2 and al2o3 contents varying in ranges of 51.70 % ~ 64.14 % and 15.59 % ~ 21.55 % , respectively .
they show high ree abundance ( σree = ( 166.80 ~ 246.21 ) * 10-6 , with ( la / yb ) n of 5.78 ~ 7.47 , ( gd / yb ) n of 1.24 ~ 1.58 and δeu of 0.72 ~ 0.90 ) .
these rocks are characterized by enrichment in lile and depletion in hfse with significant nb-ta and p-ti negative anomalies , showing an affinity to island-arc rocks .
10hn13b samples , representative of the andesite in the chenxing area , yielded la-icp-ms zircon u-pb ages of 241 ~ 2312 ma with three age-clusters of 546 ± 10 ma , 431 ± 5 ma and 345 ± 4 ma .
our data show that late paleozoic sequence in the chenxing area might be deposited at early carboniferous period . in combination with other geological observations , it is inferred that early carboniferous andesitic island possibly occurred along the banxi-chenxing area , central hainan
a set of zircon u-pb geochronogical and in-stiu hf isotopic data was presented for the xin ′ anzhai granite along the ailaoshan tectonic zone in west yunnan province .
their εhf ( t ) values range from -9.8 ~ -6.2 for 10hh-43b and -11.1 ~ -3.1 for 10hh-45b with mean values of -7.6 and -6.9 , respectively .
the corresponding two-stage hf model ages range from 1.67 ~ 1.90 ga and 1.47 ~ 2.00 ga .
these data together with other observations indicate that the xin ′ anzhai peraluminous biotite monzonitic granite originated from the metagreywacke in the proterozoic ailaoshan metamorphic complex and formed in the syn-collisional setting in response to the assemblage of the yangtze with simao-indochina blocks
the babaoshan granite intrusion in lushi county , henan province , is tectonically located in the southern margin of north china craton , on the western part of east qinling orogen .
the granite intrusion occurs as circular column which might have been the neck of volcanic edifice ; while the associated iron ore deposit with accompanying cu-mo-pb-zn mineralization makes it a unique target for metallogenetic investigation in east qinling area .
the babaoshan granite intrusion is a zoned granitic stock consisting of syenogranite porphyry in the outer zone and biotite monzogranite porphyry in the inner zone .
la-icp-ms zircon u-pb determination indicates that the syenogranite porphyry and biotite monzogranite porphyry are roughly coeval , formed at 146.6 ± 1.6 ma and 145.9 ± 1.9 ma , respectively .
zircon hf isotope compositions of the syenogranite porphyry and biotite monzogranite porphyry are proximately identical , with εhf ( t ) values vary in ranges of -27.55 ~ -20.71 and -27.30 ~ -21.90 , with hf crustal model ages ( tdm2 ) of 1.80 ~ 2.93 ga and 2.03 ~ 2.92 ga , respectively , indicative of crustal origin .
considering the tectonic evolution and geochemical characteristics of the granite as well as other mesozoic granites in the southern margin of north china craton , we suggest that the babaoshan granite along with other mesozoic granites was most likely derived from partial melting of subducted crust of yangtze craton , and possibly with minor involvement of the taihua group and xiong ′ er group under extensional tectonic regime following depression of the subduction-collision between the yangtze and north china cratons
following the random characteristics of ice accretion process , a prediction method is proposed to investigate the density of ice accretion under different atmospheric conditions .
based on the property of droplet motion , a random walk model for the droplets along ice structure has been introduced to simulate the ice accretion process . as a result , the effects of model parameters including freezing and motion parameters on ice density could be obtained . in addition , a relationship between atmospheric factor and two parameters of random-walk model has been established . consequently , different types of ice structure and density could be predicted .
simulation results show that the ice density and accretion structure predicted by introduced random walk model agree qualitatively with experimental observations
the axial compression ( or extension ) testing has been a major method for studying the mechanical properties and microstructure evolution of rocks during their deformation processes .
the paterson-type gas medium high-pressure high-temperature ( hpt ) machine is the state of art apparatus for the axial deformation testing of the middle-lower crustal rocks , due to its high precision in stress measuring ( ± 0.1 mpa ) .
however , during the rock deformation testing , the piston will be deformed accordingly , the iron jacket will support part of the load force , and the cross-section of sample will increase , therefore , the stress and strain calculated from recorded data of hpt should be nominal stress and nominal strain , which deviate from the true stress and strain .
thus , corrections corresponding to each factor causing errors must be carried out .
in this paper , three corrections , those are sample distortion correction , strength correction and cross-section correction , are introduced , to make domestic scholars get familiar with the hpt machine .
then we can accomplish much more structural deformation studies .
in addition , the marble axial deformation data are chosen as example to show the correction steps and the deviation before and after each calibration
the indosinian orogeny is an important tectono-magmatic event in south china , it deeply influence today ′ s landform and geomorphology of south china .
we present in this paper a study on detrital zircon u-pb ages of the early jurassic dongkeng siltstone in eastern part of the nanling range .
four prominent age peaks , i. e . 196 ma , 238 ma , 364 ma and 427 ma are obtained , suggesting that the siltstone was deposited in early jurassic rather than sinian to cambrian .
absence of 260 ~ 290 ma zircon ages indicates a proximal source for the sedimentary rocks .
furthermore , we compare the detrital zircon age of our results with those of the late triassic standstone from wenbinshan formation in southwestern fujian and middle-late permian sandstone in south china , conclusions can be speculated that early indosinian magmatism ( 290 ~ 260 ma ) developed mainly in the coastal region of south china and the late indosinian magmatism ( 240 ~ 200 ma ) occurred in south china interior .
denudation of indosinian orogen in south china should be considerable progressed at ca . 190 ma due to the exposoure of indosinian granites
in this paper , the azubai pegmatite ore field in the central altay , which is around 500 km2 with the centre coordinate of 88 ° 48 ′ e and 47 ° 56 ′ n , is studied . remote sensing images of aster , rapideye , quickbird and envisat-asar are used to extract prospecting information on pegmatite deposits in the azubai region .
greisenization and albitization are the main alterations closely associated with mineralization .
based on the spectral characteristics , the method of feature-orientated principal component selection ( fpcs ) was used to optimize the aster band combination of 1-4-6-7 and 1-4-6-9 to extract greisenization and albitization respectively .
aster thermal infrared data were used to estimate the surface content of sio2 , k2o and na2o based on empirical formula , which provide effective technical support for the classification of magmatic rocks and effective basis for mapping and locating of the contact zones of different lithologies .
it is the high reflectivity of pegmatite in the spectral range from visible to near infrared that provides the important physical basis for automatic identification and remote sensing interpretation of pegmatite .
the pegmatite interpreted from quickbird image with spatial resolution of 0.61 m was used to validate the automatic extraction of pegmatite from rapideye image with 5m spatial resolution whose accuracy is about 86 % .
the conjunction parts of geological structures , contact zones of lithologies and superposed parts of pegmatite enrichment zones and alteration anomalies are the important basis for metallogenic prediction .
according to above factors derived from remote sensing , four target areas were delineated , which will provide guidance for further prospecting

the newly discovered chamuhan w-mo deposit is located in the northwest of keshiketeng county , inner mongonia .
comparing with other mo or mo-bearing deposits in the regional , it is believed that the chamuhan w-mo deposit is the result of the tectonic transaction in east china . the re contents of molybdenites in chamuhan vary in range of 0.127 μg / g to 2.317 μg / g , averaging 0.875 μg / g .
as re content in molybdenite can be used as an important indicator on source of ore-forming material , it is likely that the ore-forming material in the chamuhan w-mo deposit was derived from the upper crust
this paper presents researches of the petrography , microthermometry , and composition of fluid inclusions of the shizishan copper deposit .
the results show that the ore fluid is h2o-nacl system in this area .
the fluid inclusions can be divided into three types , i. e . , daughter mineral-bearing fluid inclusion ( s-type ) , liquid fluid inclusion ( w-type ) and vapor fluid inclusion ( v-type ) . most of the daughter mineral in s-type is halite , with vanishing temperature higher than homogenization temperature of vapor-liquid .
its homogenization temperature and salinity vary in ranges of 192 ℃ to 570 ℃ and 31.2 % to 69.63 % nacleqv , respectively , which suggest a deep sourced fluid .
the homogenization temperature of w-type ranges from 98 ℃ to 583 ℃ , and salinity is low to medium , from 3.55 % to 22.98 % nacleqv .
v-type inclusion is characterized by high-temperature ( 454 ℃ of homogenization temperature on average ) and low-salinity ( 9.54 % nacleqv on average ) .
the coexistence of different phase ratios of all types ′ fluid inclusions in high temperature stage , with similar homogenization temperature , indicated that the ore-forming fluid experienced boiling .
the dongtai depression is the richest region of petroleum resources in the subei basin of eastern china .
temperature data from 54 system temperature wells and 243 test wells are used to calculate the subsurface formation temperature at the depths between 1000 and 3500 m and the bottom boundary temperature from the sanduo formation ( e2s ) to taizhou formation ( k2t ) , and the present-day geothermal gradient , respectively .
the distribution of geothermal field in the dongtai depression is divided into a few independent subunits like sags and sub-sags . in general , the temperature linearly increases with depth and the geothermal gradient in shallow formation is lower than that in the deep formation .
the geothermal gradients are 22 ~ 30 ℃ / km and 28 ~ 38 ℃ / km , respectively , for formations from sanduo to dainan ( e2s-e2d ) and formations from funing to taizhou ( e1f-k2t ) , averaging is about 30 ℃ / km , which indicate the influence of structures of sedimentary rocks on geothermal gradients .
the general pattern of temperature at different depth is higher in the positive tectonic units and lower in the negative tectonic units , which is similar to the geothermal gradient .
the geothermal field of the dongtai depression is warm , which is governed by the structures , the thickness of sedimentary , deep faults , groundwater , and radioactive heat production in the strata .
most parts of the dongtai depression is still in liquid oil window , the majority of petroleum reservoirs distributes at the underground golden zones of hydrocarbon exploration and development where temperatures are over 60 ℃ , and liquid oil migration is at depth of 20 km .
the anqing-yueshan cu-fe deposit is located in the arc-shaped cu-fe metallogenetic belt near the east wing of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river .
the limestone of the middle and upper carboniferous huanglong group and chuanshan group provided a substantial part of the ore source needed for mineralization , and the ore body was mainly located in the collapse and inflection points of the fold , as well in the contact strip of the rock with invaded rock , thus the ore body was strikingly fracture-controlled .
the rock body associated with the copper mineralization in the region was mainly the dioritic rock .
analysis showed that the anqing-yueshan copper mine was a generalized skarn deposit which mainly resulted from the intermediate to low temperature-magmatic hydrothermal liquids

based on the principle of isochronic correlation , the sequence stratigraphic framework of the first member of dainan formation is established , and the sandbodies of intermediate term cycles are tracked and correlated .
the result shows that the upside of shigang fault and the lvzhuang tectonic zone are loss of the msc3 , the sandbodies are mainly distributed in the west of jinnan area and the downside of shigang fault , the character of stratigraphic onlap is apparent .

the results of zircon u-pb dating indicate that the 206pb / 238u age range of 10 analysis points of sample hs601 is 150 ~ 160 ma with the weighted average of 156.5 ± 1.6 ma and mswd of 1.11 .
eleven analysis points of sample hs102 is 153 ~ 159 ma with the weighted average of 154.7 ± 1.7 ma and mswd of 0.77 .
fourteen analysis points of samples hs505 is 151 ~ 160 ma with the weighted average of 156.5 ± 1.4 ma and mswd of 1.16 .
the age range of the volcanic rocks from hongshanzi basin is 157 ~ 155 ma , which belongs to the early late jurassic .

in particular , the relations with the non-euclide-an geometry and the general relativity are searched , and some concrete results are calculated .
the metamorphic rocks of the wenquan group in the northern chinese tianshan have been regarded as paleoproterozoic in age .
according to our field observations and zircon shrimp u-pb dating , the wenquan group can be subdivided into three lithotectonic units : ( 1 ) pre-early neoproterozoic meta-volcanic and meta-sedimentary rocks , including amphibolite , micaschist , quartz schist , biotite gneiss and marble ;
( 2 ) early neoproterozoic migmatite and orthogneiss ;
and ( 3 ) undeformed early paleozoic gabbro and diorite .
all these three units were intruded by two-mica granite or dykes .
migmatite and granitic gneiss collected from the south of wenquan city yielded zircon shrimp u-pb ages of 926 ± 12 ma and 907 ± 11 ma , respectively . these ages are close to those of neoproterozoic granitoids occurring in the chinese tianshan .
previous results of a nd isotopic study on orthogneiss indicate an origin of partial melting of continental crust , and the occurrences of synchronous migmatite support a thickening and partial melting of continental crust .
gabbro and diorite intruded in the granitc gneiss and amphibolite of the wenquan group .
a diorite yields a zircon shrimp u-pb age of 452 ± 7 ma , and contains inherited zircons with older ages of 1.1 ga and 1.4 ga .
according to the previous studies , the gabbro and diorite have geochemical features of &amp; nbsp ;
the evolution characteristics of cloud-to-ground ( cg ) lightning activity and its relationship with radar echo during a severe squall line in shandong peninsula on july 31,2007 have been studied using the cg lightning location data from shandong meteorological bureau and the qingdao doppler radar base data .
the results show that cg lightning was quite active during this squall line , the maximum cg flash frequency was up to 1 212 fl · ( 10 min ) -1 , but there were only 15 positive cg flashes during it &apos;s lifetime .
during the rapid developing stage of the squall line , it can be seen that there were two steep increase periods of flash frequency , and there was a step-shaped trend in cg flash evolution .
most of cg flashes occurred in the regions with radar reflectivity ≥ 35 dbz at 6 km altitude .
the correlation coefficient between cg flash frequency and intense echo area ( ≥ 45 dbz ) was 0.89 , but still there were a few cg flashes scattering in the regions with weaker echo . further study indicates that there was a strong positive correlation between convective intensity and cg flash frequency .
comparing with 35 dbz and 50 dbz , the relationship between cg flash frequency and the top height of 45 dbz echo was better , and their correlation coefficient was 0.71 .
in order to quantitatively analyze the relationship between convective intensity and flash frequency , eight convective intensity indices have been developed .
among these indices , both the total of intense radar reflectivities ( ≥ 35 dbz ) above 0 ℃ level and the total of the products of intense radar reflectivities ( ≥ 35 dbz ) above 0 ℃ level and their heights appeared steady relations with cg flash frequency .
comparing with another weaker convective system , it was found that the stronger the convection , the better the correlation between convective intensity and cg flash frequency .
in addition , both ice precipitation content above 0 ℃ level and that between 7 ~ 11 km were also closely related to cg flash frequency , both correlation coefficients were greater than 0.8
the relationship between oasis water consumption and surface runoff of the weigan river basin was analyzed by using noaa / avhrr ndvi remote sensing data collected from 1982to 2006 .
the results showed that during the recent 25years , both of oasis zone inflow and oasis water consumption were increased . the oasis water consumption was broke in 1995 , which was delayed by 1year compared to the break point of oasis inflow .
comparing with the beginning stage of the study , oasis ndvi and oasis area were increased by 94 % and 73.7 % respectively , both showed a continuous increased trends .
from view of the relationship between oasis ndvi and surface runoff , oasis precipitation played an important role in oasis zone vegetation growth , while glacier runoff was regulating oasis inflow and maintaining stability of oasis .
changes in oasis area and basin surface runoff , the contributions of oasis precipitation , glacier runoff and precipitation runoff to oasis scale were 22 % , 44 % and 34 % , respectively .
however , from the assumption of scenarios of climate change and cryospheric change , the contribution of glacier runoff to oasis scale will be increased slowly in the future except under the scenario of the stable temperature ; meanwhile the contribution of oasis precipitation to oasis scale will increase

the emerging new concepts of sandy mass-transport deposits ( smtd ) and bottom-current reworked sands ( bcrs ) have made a big impact on conventional turbidite concepts .
sediment failures near the shelf edge are the common cause of gravity-driven downslope processes .
mass-transport processes , which include slide , slump , and debris flow , exhibit elastic and plastic behaviors due to high sediment concentration ( 25 % -100 % by volume ) .
turbidity currents which represent viscous fluid behavior with low sediment concentration ( 1 % -23 % by volume ) are not mass-transport processes .
four common bottom currents are thermohaline , wind-driven , deep tidal , and baroclinic types . a distinctive attribute of bcrss is their traction structures .
however , depositional aspects of baroclinic currents associated with internal waves and tides are poorly understood .
seismic facies and geometries are unreliable for distinguishing types of smtds and bcrss in the ancient record . the only reliable method of distinguishing a specific depositional facies is by detailed bed-by-bed examination of sedimentological features in core and outcrop .
short-term events that represent only a matter of hours or days ( e. g . , earthquakes , tsunamis , tropical cyclones , etc . ) are more important in triggering sediment failures than periods of sea-level lowstands that represent thousands of years

in the process of low-rank coalbed methane ( cbm ) enrichment and accumulation , hydrogeological condition is one of the main control factors , which is crucial to affect coalbed methane conservation , migrating and development .
this paper analyzes coalbed hydrogeological characteristics of tuha and santanghu basins , makes comparisons with the similar basins abroad , and suggests that because the climate in northwestern china was arid since quaternary , the hydrogeological conditions of coal seams in tuha and santanghu basins were generally poor , &quot; dry coal seams &quot; similar to alberta basin in canada were then formed , which greatly influenced the formation of cbm
recent found pillow lava basalts in the southwestern langshan and its preliminary dating has been reported here .
previous survey had assigned its age at the early paleozoic .
32 zircons from pillow lava basalts have been dated using la-icp-ms.most zircons from basalts are captured from the basement , the distribution of ages and internal structures of which are complicated .
four groups of zircons have been distinguished by their internal structures . among them the tabular zircons have been believed as the autogenetic zir cons of pillow lava basalts , the ages of these zircons range from the end of permian to the early triassic .
the rest zircons in the samples are all from the alashan basement , among which paleoproterozoic and newarchaeozoic zircons and paleozoic zircons are most .
the latest late permian langshan basalts may developed in the extensional tectonics resulting from the delamination of the lithosphere after the closure of the paleoasian ocean , the extension of this period occurred along the whole north margin of the north china plate including the alashan block , which means that the alashan block jointed with the north china plate at least before the late paleozoic
the rock compressibility has always been the focus of reservoir workers ;
and the influence of clay characteristics on the rock compressibility gets more attention in recent years .
rock is regarded as two-component model &apos; clay + matrix &apos; , based on definition of rock compressibility and theories of elastic mechanics , two-component rock compressibility formula is derived ;
thus the theoretical relationship between the rock compressibility and content of clay as well as the mechanical properties of clay has been found .
clay-containing sandstone cores from daniudi gas field are regarded as the research objects , the compressibilities of these cores are measured by triaxial compression experiment with variable internal pressures , the micro-experimental study is carried out simultaneously .
theoretical values of compressibility of these cores are obtained by using the two-component rock compressibility formula as well as the other traditional mathematical methods which do not take clay into consideration .
by comparison among the theoretical values of compressibility of different mathematical methods and the measured ones , two-component rock compressibility is proved the closest to the experimental result , which indicates the rationality of theory of two-component rock compressibility , this theory develops a new ideal for predicting the reservoir compressibility
with the development of quaternary glacier research and the increase of the absolute ages , comparison of glacial sequence and marine isotope stage ( mis ) is better than before .
the further division of glaciation ( glacial stage ) and interglacial ( interglacial stage ) lead to the emergence of some problems reflected by the influence of the procedures of traditional glaciation on the comparison between quaternary glaciation in china and mis.the main problems are as follows : the glacial sequence with absolute ages corrected the previous glaciation division according to the relative geomorphology , however , the modified results have not propagated as soon as possible .
( 1 ) it is useful to find one or more new events of quaternary glacial advance when correlating the glaciation ( glacial stage ) or inter-glacial ( stage ) to the even stage of the mis in the future .
( 2 ) as the influence of 100 ka ratio of the earth orbit , the glacial development in china has been greatly influenced by the major climate change since the middle pleistocene .
the glacial extents are accordant with the global ice volume from the kunlun glaciation to zhonglianggan glaciation .
however , the glacial extents of the early and / or middle stages were not consistent with the global ice volume during the last glacial cycle . it is intensively indicated that the glacial occurrence might depend on the coupling control of the regional climate and the tectonic uplift . the name of different glacial sequences should be modified considering the suitable application and convenient correlation in different regions .
the authors recommend that the dali glaciation and guxiang glaciation should be used to replace the last glacial cycle and penultimate glaciation respectively . more importantly , whatever the misunderstanding during the course of the correlation between the glacial sequence and the moraine isotope stage curves , lack of reliable and comparable absolute dating results leads to these questions unresolve
in order to make sense of development characteristics of volcanic reservoir and to help empolder volcanic reservoir effectively , pore structure characteristics of volcanic reservoir of the member1 of yingcheng formation in xudong area in xushen gas field were studied . 63 cores data and 206 analyzing-testing data were used .
the results indicated that the reservoir in study area was middling-low in pore and permeability , and permeability was higher in some areas because of fractures developed . physical properties and pore structures were different in different lithologies . and heterogeneity of pores strongly developed .
pore and permeability and pore median radius were best parameters to evaluate pore structure . pore structure could be carved up into four types of ⅰ,ⅱ,ⅲ and ⅳ . and type ⅱ and type ⅲ took the leading roles .
pores and throats distributed inhomogeneously , and they were different in different areas or layers . as a whole , the connectivity of throats was poor .
type ⅰ and type ⅱ of pore structure mainly developed in the areas of west and northeast of the central section in the dominating layer of yc1i1 in plane

finally we contrast the cave strain and gps strain , and discuss the possible reasons of the difference
the deep zone of songliao basin is made up of a group of separated fault depressions . the volcanic rocks are the major reservoirs for deep gas exploration .
based on systematically analyses of the formation condition and the gas accumulation pattern , it is suggested that the deep volcanic gas reservoirs are characterized by the short distant migration , distribution around main trough and along the fault , and controlled by source rocks , reservoirs and faults .
the areas with both developed source rocks and volcanic reservoirs are the favorable exploration zones .
for exploration prospect , there are many fault depressions that have not yet made a breakthrough , such as yingcheng formation and huoshiling formation which are all exploration targets with potentials .
the widespread deep clastic rocks where the source rocks directly connected with reservoirs in large area could be as important succeeding zones for deep exploration in this basin
this paper presents a geological prediction method of thin shoal facies reservoir through the analysis of shoal facies reservoir &apos;s genetic mechanism of the middle-upper cambrian xixiangchi group in the weiyuan area , sichuan basin .
the development of shoal facies reservoirs is controlled by shoal thickness . both sedimentary rates and scales of the shoal are closely related to microtopographic highs , which can develop inheritably for a long time under a stable tectonic background .
so we present a prediction method that depositional microtopographic highs and shoal reservoirs &apos; development probability can be portrayed by the thickness variation of isochronal geological bodies , which mainly composed of grain stone formed in a short time .
based on it , a prediction model was built for thin shoal facies reservoirs of the middle-upper cambrian xixiangchi group , where useful geological data are extremely poor .
the method was used to predict the distribution of shoal facies reservoirs within the research area . later drilling showed that the prediction is consistent with the drilling result . this study can provide reference to the exploration of shoal facies reservoirs

the proposed method can give a reference for facility development and test research in future lunar exploration
autocyclicity could not be over-emphasized in correlation of sand sub-zone and sand layer of oilfield development , because the sequence structure , and sequence distribution was not only controlled by allocyclicity , but also affected by autocyclicity .
effects of some autocyclicity actions on structure and distribution were further studied , combined with the study of allocyclicities control , the sequence structures high-resolution sequence correlation modes in fan delta were proposed .
under the control of autocyclicity-allocyclicity , 3 types ( a , b and c ) of sequence structures and 7 common high-resolution sequence structures ( a1 , a2 , b1 , b2 , c1 , c2 and c3 ) can be subdivided in fan delta .
the stratigraphy can be contrasted according to 3 modes , such as unequal-thickness incline correlation mode , equal-elevation strata correlation mode and aclinic line correlation mode
to carry out deep borehole wire-line coring drilling technical study in iron mines , the exploration borehole zk5604 has been selected in the xincai iron mine .
using common drilling technology drilled the overlying quaternary and neogene strata up to depth 668.49m , reamed with φ152mm bit and lowered down φ114.3mm casing to 661.82m , then drilled with xjsφ77mm wire-line coring drilling .
after drilled to 730m more , φ71mm wire-line rods and subs fracture phenomena were frequent , causing wire-line coring drilling interrupted .
then common drilling with φ94mm diamond bit has been used to drill through lower part strata up to the terminal depth of 1412m .
the analyses considered that : the main causation of frequent accidents is mainly from wire-line drilling rod fatigue failure , unreasonable drilling graduation , equipment failure and unskillful operation etc .
corresponding countermeasures have been put forward , thus accumulated data for wire-line coring drilling study in the area

the northeastern sector exploration area , hushan coal basin , inner mongolia is situated in the hailar mesozoic-cenozoic depression ; coal-bearing strata mainly belong to cretaceous yimin formation .
according to available geological data and new preliminary exploration result , considered that the total structural form is a composite syncline with gentle strata occurrence and medium structural complexity ;
based on the lithologic features , the yimin formation can be divided into lower , middle and upper 3 members , mineable coal seams are mainly concentrated in upper and lower members , with variable seam thickness .
coal seam thickness is large in the synsedimentary syncline axis , thinning even thin out toward two limbs and basin margin , in which the coal seam no. 3-4 has larger thickness and mostly mineable , thus a stable coal seam .
the coal resource is abundant in the area , estimated total coal resource is 2.2839 billion tons , adapted for large and extra large typed mechanical mining , and met the requirements for large type coal power and coal chemical energy base
but such small amounts of impurities did not cause apparent change in the quartz lattice parameters .
from far away from ore body rock → near ore body rock → mineralized rock , the crystallinity and order degree of quartz are higher and higher .
and the quartz in the mineralized rock has a trend to change into low symmetry quartz .
it &apos;s a unique to mineralized rock that the quartz &apos;s absorption peak at 1 050 cm-1 was split into two strongest ones . it can be used as the signs of whether exists mineralization .
the cause for the quartz microstructure changes may be related to the activities of late mineralized hydrothermal fluids .
late hydrothermal influence was very weak to the quartz far away from ore body rock .
and through the impact of the multi-stage hydrothermal effect , the quartz in mineralized rock may be purified by recrystallization and structural adjustment .
however the quartz in near ore body rock didn &apos;t have enough hydrothermal influence , so it &apos;s not pure .
genealogy research technology is a useful technique for in-depth exploration of study area mineralization process and metallogenic regularity
jiuquan basin is a composite basin which experienced rifting and depression stages in the early cretaceous .
the basin expe rienced the evolution phases of rifted basin in the early cretaceous and foreland basin in the cenozoic .
affected by the joint action of siberia plate , pacific plate and india plate as well as the thermal event in depth , jiuxi area was in an extensional rifting phase during the early cretaceous .
the sediments can be divided in upward succession into chijinqiao formation , chijinpu formation , xiagou formation and zhonggou formation . the strata are thick in the southwest and thin in the north .
studies of the sedimentary facies show that the xiagou and zhonggou formations were mainly characterized by the coarse clastic rock in foreland of mountain , fluvial sandstone and lacustrine mudstone , and coarse-fine-coarse and coarse-fine sedimentary successions comprised the xiagou formation and the zhonggou formation respectively .
the xiagou formation developed lacustrine-braided fluvial delta facies and basic volcanic rocks , corresponding to the maximum rifting degree , whereas the zhonggou formation developed fluvial fan-meandering river facies , corresponding to the shrinkage of the depression .
studies show that the lake was deep in southwest jiuquan basin while shallow in northern jiuquan basin in the early cretaceous . the center of subsidence and depocenter were located in the changma-hanxia area , dominated by lacustrine deposits ;
the north border was in xinminpu-hongliuxia area , dominated by delta-shallow lake deposits .
in a word , the characteristics of sedimentary successions and sedimentary environments of the lower cretaceous strata in jiuxi area indicate a complete tectonic cycle starting with embryonic rifting stage ( chijinqiao formation and chijinpu formation ) , followed then by extensional rifting stage ( xiagou formation ) and finally by depression shrinkage stage ( zhonggou formation )

after that , design of a chip-scale quantum interference magnetometer was discussed in detail , and the performance expectations and prospects for its application in marine magnetic survey was given
the huangzhuang-gaoliying fault is an important active fault in the beijing plain area . the serious disasters of ground fissure have occurred along the miaocheng-gaoliying section , which have caused a lot of wall cracking and road damages .
it indicated that the entire quaternary strata were broken by the fault and the position of fracture surface on the ground was completely consistent with that of ground fissures from the trench excavation in the xiwanglu village .
the results show that the formation age of the strata on both sides of the fault ranged from 13 ka to 22 ka , namely late pleistocene . in addition , it demonstrates that the huangzhuang-gaoliying fault is still in activity from the development of the ground fissure

distribution , activity and evolution of faults are the core of structure research , and also the key problems for oil and gas exploration of rift basins .
a large number of high-precision 3-d seismic data revealed that the fault distribution and assemblage of rift basins are very complicated and the classic structural theory fails to give a reasonable explanation to the anderson &apos;s model .
the complexity and evolution and rule of faults in rift basins can not be revealed by the existing multi-phase superposition model and oblique extension model .
taken the zhangjuhe structural belt in bohai bay basin and weixinan sag of beibuwan basin as trial areas , combined with full-covering high-precision 3-d seismic data , complicated fault distribution and assemblage in two typical oil-rich rift basin regions , this research conducted objective sandbox modeling experiment , and this shows the basic structural characteristics of the study areas .
the basic characteristics of fault system in rift basin revealed by sandbox modeling are : 1 ) the faults controlled by basement pre-existing fabric constitute the basic framework of basin fault system ;
2 ) the fault formation and evolution are controlled by basement pre-existing fabric trend , regional extension direction and extension amount .
the firstly formed faults are those controlled by rigid-border basement pre-existing fault .
then the faults controlled by weak-zone basement pre-existing fault formed .
consequently , the fault controlled by small basement pre-existing fabric formed .
finally , faults perpendicular to regional extension direction begin to form in the area far away from the basement pre-existing fabric .
3 ) at early stage of extension , fault strike is mainly controlled by the trend of basement pre-existing fabric .
with the increasing of extension amount , the affection of extensional direction become stronger , and the faults formed in late extension stage can usually reflect regional extensional direction .
4 ) uncoordinated progressive extension process is the root cause to lead to complex fault system in rift basins .
the above-mentioned fault formation and evolution law under uncoordinated extension in rift basins revealed by objective sandbox modelling can be scientifically and rationally explained with &quot; non-coordination criterion &quot; , so it has universal significance in rift basins
when using the trigonometric series method to generate artificial seismic wave , the usually appearing problem is that the method can not account for the local defect of seismic wave .
the process of generation was analysed and the defects of trigonometric series method were demonstrated .

with the analysis of geophysical interpretation , field work and landform features based on the digital elevation model , we study northward spreading of the north tian shan since midpleistocene .
along the basal decollement which dips to south at a low angle in crust , upper layers which consist of active folds and thrusts were shortened and slipped to north .
a flood plain was formed as a result of humid climate in early mid-pleistocene .
the surface of the basin was partitioned into several parts by thrusts and folds .
at the same time , partitioned basins were distorted and the crust in the north tian shan uplifted and tilted from south to north .
since ~ 600ka b.p.in mid-pleistocene , the climate became increasingly drier in the north tian shan . the surface of the northern range-front basin was slightly eroded with the low runoff . as a result of shortening , uplift of crust almost totally converted to uplift of the surface . the surface of range-front basin uplifted from south to north .
on the other hand , relief of more than 1000m induced by continuing uplift and dry climate at a timescale of 600ka supported large slope for incision of the rivers . since 30ka b.p. , the rivers on the north flank of the tian shan were intensely incised to about 300m

according to gps velocities , data of geophysical fields and geomorphological features , we further divide the bayan har block into three subblocks , aba ( i1 ) , maerkang ( i2 ) , and longmenshan ( i3 ) , and divide the xiqinling block into two subblocks , minxian ( iv1 ) and lixian ( iv2 ) , and then check the relative independence among those blocks by f-test .
the modern translation and rotation rates of those blocks were calculated using the gps data from the crustal motion observation network of china between 1999 and 2007 .
the results show that besides the eastward or southeastward translation the subblocks also rotate around the euler pole ;
the slip rates for the eastern kunlun fault , ganzi-yushu fault , and the xianshuihe fault are much higher than that for the longmenshan fault ;
the faults trending northwest or northwest-west show apparently left-lateral strike-slip and with a tensile characteristic , and those faults trending northeast show obviously right-lateral strike-slip and compression characteristics , except for the chengxian-taibai fault which shows left-lateral and compression characteristics .
the eastward motion of bayan har block is accommodated mainly by the longriba fault and minjiang fault , and the right-lateral horizontal component of longriba fault is obviously ~ 4.8 ± 1.6mm / a , and this may indicate that the eastward motion of bayan har block is discontinuous .
the longmenshan fault was divided into three segments by maerkang subblock , longmenshan subblock and minxian subblock .
the strain rate on the middle part of the longmenshan fault is smaller than that on the southern part , and the deformation northwest of the fault shows that near the fault the strain rate becomes smaller , it maybe imply that high strain energy had accumulated before the earthquake , which promoted the surface rupture .
the change from thrust motion to thrust and right strike-slip motion revealed by the surface ruptures and focal mechanism of aftershocks of wenchuan earthquake may be related to the change of the stress on the middle part of the longmenshan fault from southwest to northeast .
the low velocity of maerkang , longmenshan , and minxian subblocks relative to the south china block , the low strain rate and the tightly locked character of longmenshan fault may determine the low slip rate of the longmenshan fault

numerous extended-range numerical ensemble forecasting experiments are performed with a global spectral model ( t106l19 ) , which are initialized by breeding generated modes , and each experiment has two sets of model integrations forced by climatic ssts and predicted ssts , respectively .
based on model results , an analysis of variance approach is utilized to investigate the impact of initial and sst forcing on temporal and spatial distribution of extended-range predictability and relevant mechanisms . four indexes are defined that are index of initial error influences ( ii ) , index of sst influences ( ei ) , potential predictability index ( r ) , and wave activity index ( wi ) .
it was shown that the distribution of ii has significant regional and seasonal differences , suggesting that the influences of initial error conditions on mid-high latitudes are greater than that on tropics for extended-range forecast .
ei has similar distribution to iiin same seasons .
rexhibits zonal distribution obviously , and larger values are located in tropical regions . within low-latitude belts , potential predictability is larger at high layers than that at low layers , and it is larger in summer and autumn seasons than that in spring and winter seasons .
results show that the impact of initial error conditions and ssts forcing on temporal and spatial distribution of extended-range predictability relies on general circulation strongly .

finally , by evaluating the results of supervised classification , we can get the consequence , which can be seen that the overall classification accuracy of each period is more than 85 % , meeting the classification requirements
there were gradations of the sedimentary facies from the coastal plain in the northeastern part to the littoral-shallow sea in the southwestern part in the chindwin-shwebo basin , myanmar prior to the pliocene .
the delta facies is less developed , and the volcanic rocks interruptedly display a ns-directed arrangement in the central part of the basin .
the tectonism , volcanism and sea-level changes are responsible for the formation of the sedimentary environments .
the broad and gentle tectonic settings are interpreted as the key factors for the formation of the coastal plain and littoral-shallow sea environments .
the volcaniclactics from the volcanic activities within the island arc zone during the cretaceous to the miocene not only provided sediment sources for the normal deposition of the strata , but also play a destructive role in the propagation and preservation of organisms .
the sea-level changes are also considered as the important factors in controlling the distribution of depositional systems

significant remanence and demagnetization alter the intensity and orientation of total magnetization , which complicates interpretation of magnetic data .
to deal with the problem , we propose a method of inverting 2d magnetization vector distributions using the 2d borehole magnetic data .
we firstly invert the magnetization intensity distributions based on magnetic anomaly amplitudes of borehole magnetic data .
with the known magnetization intensity distributions , subsequently , we invert the magnetization orientation distributions by fitting the magnetic component anomalies .
both magnetization intensity and orientation are solved by conjugate gradients . and a preconditioned matrix is utilized to improve the inverse quality of magnetization intensity .
all synthetic examples involving significant remanence and high susceptibility demonstrate that this method is capable of accurately recovering the magnetization vector distributions .
the magnetization vector distributions comprehensively include the influences of induced magnetization , remanent magnetization and self-demagnetization . therefore , it provides an effective approach to study the ore deposits when high susceptibility and significant remanent magnetization are present
free surface related multiple elimination is very difficult for ocean bottom seismometer ( obs ) data processing and imaging . the multiples of obs data have the characteristics of strong energy and long period , which seriously impact the processing and imaging of primaries .
the interval of obs stations usually is large , which is different from conventional streamer acquisition .
therefore , the conventional wave-equation-based method of free surface related multiple elimination cannot deal with the sparse obs data .
in this paper , we introduce estimation of primaries and multiples by sparse inversion ( epsi ) to obs multiples elimination with integration of streamer data .
we first analyse the mechanism of multiples , and then give the methodology of obs multiples elimination using epsi with integration of streamer data .
by using the information of streamer data , we achieve the multiples elimination of sparse obs data .
epsi directly estimates primaries using sparse inversion , and avoids adaptive subtraction in surface related multiple elimination ( srme ) method .
therefore , epsi can preserve the effective primaries . synthetic data example demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively estimate primaries of obs data
on the basis of the analysis of the relationship between the coalbed methane ( cbm ) enrichment region and groundwater and geological structure in the north qinshui basin , the magnetotelluric method was employed to detect underground water distribution as well as the favorable and unfavorable geological factors which pose impact on coalbed methane enrichment , and indirect detection of the cbm relative enrichment region .
according to the cbm enrichment geological model and designed the geophysical model , using the finite element method to carry out the forward modeling , this work discussed the feasibility of the detection mode , based on which we selected the north qinshui basin cbm exploration area to carry out the controlled source audio magnetotelluric ( csamt ) technological experiment .
coupled with the geological , drilling and logging data , we have completed the experiment data processing and interpretation .
the results show that the use of csamt method can effectively obtain electrical structure of strata , infer water content , and water-rich areas .
combining with the favorable enrichment cbm geological conditions and influencing factors , it is possible to achieve indirect prediction of the favorable cbm enrichment region

both chemical calculations and practical analysis result indicate that the agent added each step just reacted with the objective minerals , leading to accurate and reliable result

the experiments conducted on watermarking with different compression degrees show that the algorithm is robust
origin times and locations of people-made earthquakes are known , so examining an earthquake-location technology using seismic recordings from the people-made earthquakes is one of the convincing ways .
in order to examine the trit ( time reversal imaging technique ) , we collect seismic recordings from 10people-made earthquakes , 5air-guns and 5chemical explosions .
the seismogragh network for the air-guns is smaller , about 20km across and the one for the chemical explosions is larger , about 200km across .
at first , two better velocity models were chosen out from the models available in literatures by comparing the measured values with the true ones .
then , the best one was decided further , while the final measured values for the 10events were determined based on the two models , by comparing the measured values with the true ones , as well as the uncertainties of the measured values .
the results show that , with the best velocity model , the epicenter biases for both the air-guns and chemical explosions are around 500m ;
the depth biases of the air-guns are around 100mwhile those of the chemical ones are around 200m ;
the origin time biases of the chemical ones are around 0.06s , but those of the air-guns are larger , reaching about 0.4s , which might be explained by the lower velocity of local water region .
as a conclusion , origin times and hypocenters , including even focal depths , are able to be determined at reasonable accuracy and precision by the trit
using travel time data from the sichuan seismic network and the double difference relocation algorithm , we determined accurate locations of the lushan ms 7.0earthquake and aftershocks .
the aim is to determine seismogenic faults and to place constraints on geometry of the fault plane according to the aftershock distribution , and also to analyze aftershock activities .
the results indicate that the epicenter of the lushan ms 7.0main shock is located at 30.28 ° n , 102.99 ° e and its focal depth is 16.33km.
the aftershocks are distributed within a region 32km long and 15 ~ 20km wide , with depths ranging 5 ~ 24km .
the seismic rupture extends relatively longer to the southwest of the main shock epicenter than that to the northeast . magnitudes of the aftershocks decrease rapidly with time .
focal depth distributions show a clear thrust rupture within the crust , which is a hidden fault about 10km east of the dachuan-shuangshi fault zone .
we estimate that the fault plane has a strike of 217 ° and dips to the northwest at 45 ° angle , almost parallel to the dachuan-shuangshi fault zone only with a gentle dipping angle . both of them belong to the imbricate thrust system of the longmengshan range-front fault zone .
affected by this fault , the aftershocks also occurred on the dachuan-shuangshi1fault zone , parts of which extend to the southwestern margin of the baoxing massif in the northwest .
from baoxing massif zone to the southern end of the wenchuan ms 8.0earthquake rupture zone is a 50km long seismic gap , which is considered to have a potential risk of a large earthquake in the future
after more than half century development , remarkable achievements have been made on the study of earth ′ s interior electrical structure by using the magnetotelluric method at home and abroad . the majority of these research results are based on the electrical isotropic theory .
however , the electrical anisotropy phenomenon is prevalent in the earth interior , and the presence of electrical anisotropy in the crust and upper mantle is an important link factor among geoelectric model , underground structure and tectonic model .
in this paper , the tensor conductivity has been first introduced by starting from the maxwell equations , then getting a set of partial differential equations with respect to ex and hx according to the characteristic of twodimension electrical anisotropic structure .
by using the partial differential equations , the appropriate solution of ex and hx has been solved , and working out other field components on the basis of ex and hx .
then , in order to recognize the characteristics of electromagnetic propagation under common and certain geological conditions , the influence on the measured magnetotelluric has been researched by the forward simulation on ordinary and special two-dimension anisotropic electrical structure , which has laid theoretical foundation for the subsequent processing and interpretation of magnetotelluric measured data .
base on the cutting edge technology , a 3-d electronic sand table model of guangxi province was built for flood control simulation .

we investigate the crustal velocity structure of the sichuan basin based on ambient noise tomography using continuous waveform data recorded by the chongqing telemetry network and other permanent stations in the region from january to december of 2012 .
by extracting the dispersion information of rayleigh waves from empirical green functions ( egfs ) , we invert the phase velocity of surface waves for periods from 5s to 40s and further estimate s-wave velocity in 3-dimensions .
the results of phase velocity at periods of 5s and 10s indicate that the sichuan basin is characterized by thick sedimentary layers , of which the thickness is relatively small in the central basin .
the phase velocity at periods around 20s mainly reflects the s-wave velocity structure in middle crust , which demonstrates increasing velocity with increasing depth . the phase velocity at the period about 35s is totally high indicating that the yangtze plate has a rigid lower crust in the region .
particularly , the distinct high velocity anomalies around the wuling mountains from jishou to changde are most likely related to the paleo-volcanic chain of jiangnan paleo-continent activity which caused a large amount of basic and ultrabasic mantle material intruded into the crust .
with greater mechanical strength , it plays a certain impediment to southward escaping of material on the west of the wuling mountains gradient zone of gravity anomalies ( yunnan-guizhou plateau and the mountainous topography of the west of hubei and hunan ) , which is just located in the transition zone of the second step and the third step of china ′ s topography .
the obtained 3-dimensions s-wave velocity model is corresponding to the main geological structures within and surrounding the sichuan basin , and thus it is meaningful for further study on the deep structure and seismicity in the region
forward calculation is the base of parameters selection in field work , data processing , and interpretation ; particularly the accurate , stable and efficient three-dimensional forward solver is very important .
in this paper , based on the strategy that solving the laplace-domain electrical field firstly , then acquiring the time-domain magnetic field by gaver-stehfest algorithm , we employed staggered finite difference ( sfd ) and finite volume ( fv ) to discretize the electrical field helmholtz equation for three-dimensional forward calculation of loop source transient electromagnetic method .
comparing with the numerical solutions of integral equation ( ie ) , finite difference in time domain ( fdtd ) , vector finite element method ( vfem ) and spectral lanczos decomposition method ( sldm ) for low resistivity body in homogeneous half-space , we validated the sfd and fv algorithms .
because the unknown electrical field is arranged on the edge of brick for sfd , fv and vfem based on brick element , so these three numerical algorithms could utilize the same method for coding the unknown electrical field , computing the background field and post processing .
however , comparing with the vfem , the coefficient matrixes produced by sfd and fv are sparser , so these two algorithms are more efficient .
for low resistivity horizontal sheet model , we use sfd , fv and 1danalytical method to compute the induced electromagnetic force ( emf ) .
the results show that sfd has higher accuracy than fv , and the contours of emf for these three algorithms coincide with each other very well although the range of emf has fine distinctions
considering the limit of the single receiver tid index ( srti ) method in detecting medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances ( mstids ) , this work proposes a modified srti method to expand the detectable period scope .
the principles of srti method and modified srti method are presented and detectable period range is analyzed theoretically for both methods .
then we analyze mstids using observation data of 5igs stations in southern california on day 189,2012 .
the results show that there are two disturbance waves with the period 15min and 39 min , respectively at 21 ∶ 30-23 ∶ 00lt.the srti method detected only the former , while the modified srti method propped both of them , which means it has good sensitivity to both shortperiod disturbances and long-period disturbances .
with the disturbance sequence acquired by the modified srti method , the mstids propagation parameters are estimated using the fft phase difference method . the results are consistent with the previous studies totally .
this indicates that the modified srti method can be fully applied to the study of mstids and has advantage in processing mass data with a simple calculation procedure
it has been proposed that vlf radiations , resulting from high-frequency ( hf ) transmitter heating of the ionosphere , can be potentially used for artificial radiation belt remediation .
in the present study we first perform a parametric study of these vlf wave propagation paths and characteristics in the near-earth magnetosphere , using our own developed ray tracing code .
then , based on the resonance condition and dispersion equation , we make an analysis about the energy of electrons resonating with these artificial vlf waves .
the results indicate that vlf waves can propagate outward by magnetospheric reflection and finally settle down at certain higher l-shells in the inner magnetosphere .
the waves can propagate further when the frequency is lower or the initial latitude is higher .
but , it is also possible that vlf waves touch the ionosphere and get absorbed there without any magnetospheric reflection , if the waves are launched at very high latitudes .
in the magnetosphere , vlf waves at higher latitude or lower l-shell can resonate with higher energy electrons and at lower latitude and higher l-shell can resonate with lower energy electrons .
for higher harmonic , resonance interaction needs higher energy electrons
observations on range spread trail echoes ( rstes ) have been generally limited to high power large aperture radars .
in this study , we use trail echoes observed with the sanya ( 18.4 ° n , 109.6 ° e ) vhf radar to investigate the occurrence characteristics of rstes .
the observational results show that the generation and evolution of rstes detected by the low power coherent radar are similar to the rstes measurements made with high power radars .
the time-height distributions of rstes and specular meteor trail echoes ( ses ) , respectively observed by the coherent scattering and the all-sky meteor detection modes of the sanya vhf radar during august 2011 , are also investigated .
for short-lived rstes ( &lt; 15s ) , the mean time-height distributions are consistent with those of ses .
however , ses and long-duration rstes show significant differences in the peak occurrence time and height dependence . it is found that the long-duration rstes ( ≥ 15s ) occur earlier in the dawn side and show a clearer dependence on altitude .
furthermore , the number of ses is greater than that of rstes , which could be associated with the radar beam width and viewing geometry
considering jointly the perturbations due to earth ′ s oblateness and atmospheric air drag , the leo satellite orbit decay has been simulated for champ by numeric integration on the relevant perturbation functions to derive variations of orbit elements and calculate the satellite spatial positions .
in the simulation the newly proposed international standard atmosphere of jb-2008is used to produce the air mass density , which takes both the solar radiation and geomagnetic activity comprehensively into account .
the simulation is performed for 2005when there were not either firing for lifting the spacecraft or major attitude change and thus the spacecraft orbit underwent a natrual decay .
in order to inspect the possible change in the coefficient at higher altitude , the orbit in 2002is also simulated for the first three months .
in consideration of particular shape of the champ spacecraft and the thermospheric condition in which the spacecraft is flying , we adopted the air drag coefficient larger than 2.8and varying in a range to find the optimum drag coefficient .
it is found that for 2005year the simulated orbit altitude decay is consist with the real one best when the drag coefficient being as 2.91as large . the simulated semi-major axis length shows a standard deviation in respect with observed ones as small as 81 m .
at higher orbit altitude in 2002 , the simulated optimum drag coefficient is estimated at 3.0 .
thus the resulted coefficients are much larger than the conventionally used value of 2.2 .
the simulated decaying apogee and perigee exhibit no periodic fluctuations that exist by contrast in the real orbit decays , which may be due to neglecting the higher order gravity components in the present simulation
southeast gansu province along the central-northern portion of the south-north seismic belt , the tectonic activities and deformation pattern are closely related to the northeastward growth of the tibetan plateau .
complicated structural geometries were controlled by both eastern kunlun and west-qinling northern faults , and outward growth of the ne tibet continuously contributes to the regional active deformation .
in recent years , intermediate-strong earthquakes occurred frequently , calling for a detailed analysis .
by integrating both structural and historical seismicity studies , and combining geophysical , seismological and field investigations , we conclude that northward indenting and eastward movement along the eastern kunlun fault is the main tectonic stress source , and also it provides the basic setting and mechanism to generate strong earthquakes .
left-lateral slip and its bi-flanking thrusting &apos;flower structure &apos;of the westqinling northern fault contributed to the frequent occurrence of intermediate-strong earthquakes along the lintan-tanchang fault to the south .
minxian-zhangxian ms 6.6earthquake on july 22 , 2013along the central-eastern lintan-dangchang fault is a consequence of differential activity due to heterogeneous segments
on april 20,2013 , the lushan magnitude 7.0earthquake occurred in sichuan , china .
it is the largest earthquake occurred on the longmen shan fault since 2008 wenchuan 8.0 earthquake .
following the mainshock to date may 5,52 ( ml ≥ 4.0 ) aftershocks were recorded by the sichuan seismic network .
based on the previous velocity model results respectively for the sichuan basin and southeast area , southwest mountain area and northwest mountain area , we analyzed the broadband waveforms for mainshock and aftershock with sufficient signal-to-noise levels to invert for seismic moment tensors . we finally obtained lushan mainshock and its 16 aftershock moment tensors with the tdmt _ invc method .
we sorted the moment tensors based on the plunge of p , b , and taxes .
the results show that : the lushan earthquake ′ s magnitude is mw 6.5 , mo is 0.638 * 1019 nm , depth is 13km , and focal mechanism is reverse .
the type of the aftershocks is simple and mainly as reverse .
the lushan earthquake sequence distributed at the penxian-guanxian fault on southwest end of longmen shan fault and the focal mechanisms studied in this study mainly as reverse . this phenomenon indicate that the southwest end of longmen shan fault mainly as thrust feature .
the similar source feature , short occurrence time interval , and located in the same tectonic structure of the lushan and wenchuan earthquake , may suggest they have close relationship with each other
the effect of cutoff magnitude mc of an earthquake catalogue on the result of the analysis of earthquake sequence was investigated using the epidemic-type aftershock sequence ( etas ) model to the 2013 minxian-zhangxian , gansu , china , ms 6.6 earthquake sequence .
considering the early stage of aftershock sequence within about 1.6 days after the mainshock , etas model and modified omori-utsu relation were used to estimate the earthquake sequence parameters .
the aics of etas model are smaller than the modified omori-utsu relation for all the considered cutoff magnitude mc , implying that the sequence was better fitted by the etas model .
setting different mc from ml 1.0 to 2.5 with interval 0.1 , the stability of parameterαand p was investigated , with the comparison with the 2013 lushan , sichuan , ms 7.0 earthquake sequence .
the result shows the effect of mc on the estimation of these parameters , with p more sensitivite to mc .
n-test was performed to the probabilistic forecast of aftershocks based on etas model and &quot; thinning algorithm &quot; , indicating the effect of mc on the forecast performance for the minxian-zhangxian sequence .
acceptable result was obtained only with mc = ml 1.0 or ml 1.1 .
the analysis cautions that in the practical forward forecast of aftershock probabilities , cutoff magnitude is a key factor to be considered
the ela mountain in the east of qinghai province is one of the important structural-magmatic-metallogenetic belts of northern tibet .
in order to discuss the magmatic mineralization in the area , quartz diorite porphyrite and granite-porphyry in the saishitang polymetallic deposit were selected ; whole-rock major and trace elements and zircon u-pb la-icpms ages were analyzed .
the dating of la-icp-ms zircon u-pb of two samples shows that 27 points of oscillatory zoned domains of quartz diorite porphyrite sample yield a group of weighted mean 206pb / 238u ages at ( 223.2 ± 2.2 ) ma ( mswd = 0.82 ) and 21 points of oscillatory zoned domains of granite-porphyry sample yield a group of weighted mean 206pb / 238u ages at ( 219.9 ± 2.6 ) ma ( mswd = 0.89 ) .
the intrusive rocks were formed about 220 ma , resulted from lithospheric delemination after crustal thickening due to collision between continental plates in late indosinian
because the content of fluorine ion in water sample and the content of fluorine ion standard array are very little , collimation error will lead to large relative error to the fluorine ion standard array while compounding every day .
contrast experiments shows that the fluorine ion standard array compounding method can be changed from daily compounding to 20-day compounding and everyday observing .
the new fluorine ion standard array compounding method is more stable , easer to repeat and has lower relative error compared with the old one

the result indicated approaches its early warning rate of accuracy distinct enhancement along with the time , has the very good reference value to the lightning short-time early warning

based on the data of outcrops , organic geochemistry , the reservoir-forming conditions and exploration potential of shale gas in lower cambrian niutitang formation were investigated in the northwestern hunan , south china .
the results showed that marine mudstone-shales have good forming conditions of shale gas for the large distribution area and thickness of mudstone-shale , high organic carbon contents , fine kerogen type and high thermal evolution ( mature to over mature ) .
the development and distribution of the black mudstone-shale thickness is controlled by sedimentary facies zone , showing a gradually decreasing tendency from the deep-water shelf facies to slope facies .
through analyzing the assemblage of source , reservoir , and capping rocks , sangzhi-shimen synclinore has favorable conditions to form shale gas reservoirs , and displayed a good prospect in shale gas exploration .
the guzhang anticlinorium has experienced multiphase tectonic movements , thus the overlying strata were denuded seriously . however , the self-generation , self-storage and adsorption capacity of shale gas made it possible to have good exploration potential as well

it is still argued whether we measure phase or group velocities using acoustic logging tools .
in this paper , three kinds of models are used to investigate this problem by theoretical analyses and numerical simulations .
first , we use the plane-wave superposition model containing two plane waves with different velocities and able to change the values of phase velocity and group velocity . the numerical results show that whether phase velocity is higher or lower than group velocity , using the slowness-time coherence ( stc ) method we can only get phase velocities .
second , according to the results of the dispersion analysis and branch-cut integration , in a rigid boundary borehole model the results of dispersion curves and the waveforms of the fi rst-order mode show that the velocities obtained by the stc method are phase velocities while group velocities obtained by arrival time picking .
finally , dipole logging in a slow formation model is investigated using dispersion analysis and real-axis integration . the results of dispersion curves and full wave trains show similar conclusions as the borehole model with rigid boundary conditions

seismic reservoir prediction was the key for lithological reservoir exploration and development , and the curve of acoustic logging was also the indispensable basic information for the seismic reservoir prediction . but the better curve of acoustic logging was difficult to be obtained because of some reasons , so it was necessary to establish a quasi-acoustic curve .
the quasi-acoustic curve is based on the new curve with acoustic dimensionless , which is established by non-acoustic reservoir geophysical logging information that could reflect reservoir characteristics .
acoustic logging curve is a velocity curve in essence , it includes two components : the first is high-frequency component , which reflects horizon velocity in different formations ;
the second is low-frequency component , which reflects that formation velocity enhances with depth .
when building the acoustic logging , logging curves that are related with acoustic wave to fit high-frequency velocity components are selected , and vsp speed is used to fit low-frequency component , finally the two curves are integrated organically , it can obtain the quasi-acoustic curve that it is needed

studies have shown that . when the landslide suffers persistent heavy rainfall , the lower the permeability coefficient is , the smaller the landslide stability is .
the results can provide some scientific basis for the three gorges reservoir landslide prevention
a 3-d unstructured-grid , finite-volume coastal ocean model ( fvcom ) was used to study the tides and tidal currents in the lianzhou bay and adjacent areas .
the simulation results were in good agreement with observations . the co-tidal maps of k1 , o1 , and m2 indicated that k1 and o1 were mostly standing waves outside the lianzhou bay , while m2 had a largely propagating character .
however , all three constituents became propagating waves when entering the lianzhou bay , due to the shallow waters .
the tidal current ellipses showed the characters of k1 , o1 , and m2 constituents : k1 and o1 were rotating outside the bay , but rectilinear along the water channels inside the bay ;
m2 was mostly rectilinear over the whole area .
the tidal-induced residual current shows the flow was divided into two branches by the guantouling peninsula : one turned to flow west ; the other was blocked by the southern boundary of the peninsula , creating a clockwise circulation .
in lianzhou bay , there were two circulation systems , a cyclonic one at the top of the bay and an anti-cyclonic at the mouth

the results show that the lithology of xu 2 and xu 4 reservoirs is dominated by feldspar lithic sandstone and lithic sandstone , the main reservoir space consists of intragranular corrosion pores and intergranular corrosion pores , and the reservoirs are characterized by low porosity and low permeability with strong heterogeneity .
the pore structure is overall characterized by small pores , tiny throats , fine skewness , and poor sorting and connectivity on the mercury injection curves .
the reservoir pore structure can be divided into 4 types based on the parameters obtained by the mercury injection experiment together with the nuclear magnetic resonance experiment , and the typical characteristics of the four different pore structure types are summarized separately in this paper .
lastly the formation mechanism and controlling factors of various pore structure types are discussed in three aspects of tectonism , sedimentation , and diagenesis .
it is demonstrated that the tectonism and sedimentation are the prerequisite conditions affecting the reservoir pore structure , while the types and intensity of diagenesis and its evolution sequence are the key factors for determining the pore structure characteristics .
the above research results can provide guidance for the classified evaluation of xu 2 and xu 4 reservoirs and for the further gas exploration in the study area

landslide is one of the most serious geological hazards in the three gorges res- ervoir regions since the reservoir was in operation in 2003 .
both reservoir water level changing and rainstorm have become major factors that affect the stability of landslide .
geo- studio finite element software is adopted in numerical simulation calculation on seepage field and stability under different conditions for hydrologic station landslide .
the results show a basic stability in the landslide , a big difference in seepage fields and a small change in safety factor under different working conditions ;
the rise of water level and rainfall are detrimental to the landslide ;
because of the rise of water level , underwater rock mass gravity reduces and slip resistance paragraph stabilizing force decreases which is against landslide stability .
the research results provide scientific basis for the forecast or treatment of landslide in three gorges reservoir
construction of sluice gate in tidal estuaries could severely change local sediment dynamic conditions , as well as the topography , which often leads to the high deposition of fine sediments in channels .
based on the survey at 3 anchor stations located at sluice gate downstream in both spring and neap tidal cycles during 18-24 august 2012 , we studied the characteristics of suspended sediment concentration change in xinyanggang estuary .
the results showed that this estuary belonged to the semi-diurnal tide . the flood duration was shorter with stronger current velocity than the ebb duration during the spring tide .
there are strong sediment resuspension and siltation during a tidal cycle .
the magnitude of the resuspension flux could be as large as 10-3 kg m-2 s-1 .
this could not only lead to strong resuspension , but also transport water with high sediment concentration upstream at sluice gate , which might be the main reason for the channel siltation .
when the sluice gate was open , the fresh water resulted in a relatively strong vertical salinity gradient in the early and later stage , which leaded to the damping of sediment resuspension .
based on the data from hydrological observation and sediment sampling in kushuiyang during a tide cycle from 3rd july 2011 to 4th july 2011 , the water and sediment transport rates are calculated to specify the sediment dynamic characteristics along the tidal channel .
the geomorphological evolution and stability of the channel are also discussed on the basis of the comparison between historic sea charts and new topographic surveys . the main results turn out that tidal currents are strong in the channel .
sediments are mainly transported in the form of suspended loads . the net transport direction is landward in the nearshore part of channel , while it is generally pointed seaward in the part of channel east of sand bank ( 121.606oe , 33.029on ) .
there are large areas of late mesozoic volcanic rocks in mohe , north da hinggan mountains . among these volcanic rocks , the tamulangou formation erupted earlier than other formations .
the tamulangou formation is a set of basic to intermediate volcanic rocks , including lavas and pyroclastic rocks . the study of petrogenesis of the tamulangou formation may provide a very important insight for the tectonic evolution of north da hinggan mountains .
a systematic geochemical analysis of major and trace elements was carried out with samples from the tamulangou formation .
it is shown that most samples are alkaline basic to intermediate rocks with sio2 contents of 52.7 % -57.8 % .
these rocks are basaltic trachy andesites and trachy andesites .
compatible transitional elements such as cr , co and ni are low in contents .
trace element ratios such as nb / la , ba / nb , nb / u and ce / pb and the total rare earth elements contents of these samples vary in a large range , with a right-oblique rare earth element distribution mode .
the petrogenesis study indicates that the partial melting of the enriched continental lithospheric mantle plus a slight crustal contamination and a certain degree of fractional crystallization are responsible for the formation of the tamulangou formation volcanic rocks

long axis of positive vertical helicity is always consistent with low-level shear and lies in the east of it
iron-nickel alloys such as kamacite , taenite and tetrataenite are the most important magnetic materials in chondrites meteorites .
in this study we studied the jilin chondrite and found that kamacite containing 6 % ~ 7 % ni has lower coercivity and a curie temperature ( tc ) of 750 ℃ ;
tetrataenite containing ~ 48 % ni has higher coercivity and a tc of 565 ℃ . signals of magnetization and magnetic susceptibility are carried by the former , but remanence is carried by the latter .
troilite ( fes ) is antiferromagnetic at room-temperature and thus has no contribution to remanence , but it has a magnetic transition at ~ 60 k.troilite is rather thermally stable as heating in argon , while it is oxidized and transformed to magnetite when heating in air .
these results provide useful information in regard to magnetic properties of chondrite containing iron-nickel alloys
using the conventional data and ncep / ncar reanalysis data , this paper analyses the rainfall characters in meiyu period of zhejiang province during 2010 and the effects of south asia high and upper and lower-level jets on meiyu rainstorm .

there was corresponding between south-north oscillation of south asia high ridge line and south-north shift of rainstorm .
rainstorm was possible whether south asia high was stable or changed . rainstorm mostly occurred when south asia high changed , and southward movement was synchronous with westward , northward was synchronous with eastward .
( 3 ) in meiyu period , the evolution of upper and lower-level jets was consistent , and there was space-time corresponding between upper and lower-level jets and rainstorm .
rainstorm belt was mostly located in the right side of upper-level jet and the left side of lower-level jet axis , and it swayed south-north with the location of upper and lower-level jets .
moreover , to a certain degrees , the movement of lower-level jet from axis to north edge was coincident with rainstorm belt .
the intensity of upper and lower-level jets was closely related to rainfall .
the horizontal distance had important influence on the coupling between upper and lower-level jets , and then it effected the development of vertical velocity and precipitation intensity .
therefore , the configuration of upper and lower-level jets has good indication to area and intensity of rainstorm in meiyu period

the sensitivity test results show : ( 1 ) comparing with the satellite-monitoring image , the modeled spatial distributions of surface dust concentration of one-time assimilation experiment and intermittent assimilation experiment are more precise than those from control experiment which has no data assimilation , while the result of intermittent assimilation experiment is the most precise ;
( 2 ) one-time assimilation experiment fails to grasp the continual evolutions of pm10 concentration of the majority of single station as well as control experiment ;
( 3 ) the results of intermittent assimilation experiment capture the main features of continual evolutions of pm10 concentration at the single station ;
( 4 ) to some degree , the effect of intermittent assimilation experiment is better than that of one-time assimilation experiment .
in a total , grapes3dvardust system is able to improve the dust prediction of dust model
insurance market , as an important part of the international financial markets , is playing an important role in current global economic recovery .

a speleothem δ13c time series was reconstructed based on 962 stable isotope measurements and 7 230th dates .
the sequence covers a time range from 10.6 to 3.5 ka bp , suggesting the evolution of ecological conditions and associated climate changes . the long-term trend of the δ13c profile bears a high similarity to sst changes in north atlantic .
three phases are evident in the stalagmite δ13c record : ( 1 ) a transition to humid climate in 10.6 ~ 8.8 kabp , during which δ13c value displays negative excursions from-9.4 ‰ to-10.3 ‰ ;
( 2 ) a humid stage between 8.8 and 6.7 kabp , in which the δ13c value shows negative excursions to the minimum with an average δ13c value of-11.3 ‰ .
temporally , this period is in line with the holocene optimum ; ( 3 ) a gradually drying period from 6.7 to 3.5 kabp , during which δ13c value displays positive excursions from-11.3 ‰ to-8.3 ‰ . constrained by annual layer counting , the duration of the holocene optimum in our record is about 1945 years .
both δ13c and δ18o records show a rapid positive excursion around 6.7 kabp , indicating an abrupt climate transformation .
annual layer counting suggests that the duration of transformation is about 40 years .
it reveals that the interaction of vegetation atmosphere system and lower sst in north atlantic may amplify the influence of reduced solar insolation via feedback processes

the zhaxikang pb-zn-sb polymetallic deposit , which is located in the south tibetan detachment system , is one of the few large pb-zn-sb-ag symbiotic deposits in tibet that characterized by great variety of sulfosalt minerals .
the deposit occurs in lower jurassic ridang formation , with the rocks being carbon-bearing calcareous slate , calcareous slate , sericite slate , shale and quartz sandstone .
the ore bodies in zhaxikang deposit are mainly controlled by sn and ne-sw striking tensional faults .
the deposit was subjected to two stages : medium-low temperature hydrothermal period and hypergenesis period .
the inclusions in siderite , calcite and quartz of the medium-low temperature hydrothermal period are dominantly vapor-liquid two-phase inclusions , including a small amount of pure vapor inclusions , pure vapor co2-type inclusions and co2-h2o three-phase co2 inclusions .
in the medium-low temperature hydrothermal period , homogenization temperatures of inclusions vary from 184 to 329 ℃ with peak temperature of 255 ℃ , the salinities from 2.07 % to 12.05 % , the densities from 0.65 to 0.86 g / cm3 .
the ore-forming fluid is a medium-low temperature , low salinity , low density h2o-nacl system , with minor or trace amounts of co2 and ch4 .
the δdv-smow and δ18oh2o values of the fluids in quartz and calcite inclusions varied from-165 ‰ to-131 ‰ and from-13.7 ‰ to 10.21 ‰ , respectively , therefore , the water in the ore-forming fluids derived from precipitation .
the immiscibility which was marked by the escape of gases from the fluid occurred during the mineralization , whereas this immiscibility resulted in sulfide mineralization .
the genesis of this deposit belongs to medium-low temperature hydrothermal type formed during groundwater convection cycle driven by sedimentary-structural-geothermal activity
according to statistics , the damage caused by earthquake-induced landslides and collapses can account for about 40 % of all that causes by earthquake .
as for the mechanisms and modes of slope deformation and failure under seismic force , a lot of previous theories and achievements have been reached . but , numerical simulation research is limited .
the seismic intensity of the northern mountainous area of shifang city , sichuan province reached 11 degrees during the 5.12 wenchuan earthquake . the remote sensing system had interpreted up to 161 sites of geological hazards induced by that .
their basic failure modes are bedding-layer cutting slides and slipping collapses .
this paper considered two typical geo-hazards triggered by the 5.12 wenchuan earthquake , and analyzed their stereographic projection. it worked out the combination modes of preferred structure planes which controlled the slope stability .
then it applied numerical simulation with discrete elements software to simulate their process of failure .
the results show the following two failure modes . the first mode of slope failure during earthquake is that , the layered slopes that dip gently outwards crack its top at first , meanwhile the structure planes inside the slope start to undergo shear deformation . as the cracks on the top extend downwards and when these cracks reach the structure planes dip outwards inside the slope , the entire slope will slide along those connected planes .
their deformation and failure mechanism is slide-rip . their mode of failure is bedding-layer cutting slide .
the second mode of slope failure during earthquake is as follows . the steep block slopes crack their tops and loose themselves at first .
then the blocks cut and formed by structure planes start to undergo shear deformation along the structure planes which dip gently inwards or horizontal at the bottom of those tensile cracks . then these blocks gradually slip outwards due to the durative earthquake , roll and fall down the slopes .
their deformation and failure mechanism is rip-slip . their mode of failure is slipping collapse

the method is simple for operation , easy to grasp and could avoid developing or writing more complex softwares and procedures by the users , thus reaching a muhiplicative effect
seismic wave propagation in oil-gas reservoirs accompanies intense energy attenuation , and the higher the frequency , the faster the energy attenuation .
so the energy attenuation gradient can be applied to detecting if hydrocarbons exist in reservoirs .
the time-frequency resolution of short-time fourier transform ( stft ) is affected by window size , while wigner-ville distribution ( wvd ) is affected by cross part .
this paper computes the time-frequency distribution of seismic signals based on wvd and stft , and then estimates the seismic wave energy attenuation gradient using the quasi-linear relationship between the high frequency component energy distribution and the corresponding frequency .
the case study indicates that this method has a higher value of application in reservoir prediction

based on the hy-2 calibration flight data , the significant wave height ( swh ) is retrieved and its accuracy is compared with those from buoys and jason-1 altimeter .
for the extraction of the root mean square ( rms ) of the wave heights and hence to obtain the swh , first is to carry out waveform screening , averaging over 1 second and destriping , and then to make waveform fitting according to the hayne echo model .
the significant wave heights thus obtained are compared with those from the buoys and the jason-1 altimeter which runs along the same track as that of the hy-2 calibration flight .
the results indicate that a systematic bias is present for the accuracy of the swh resulted from the hy-2 altimeter . this bias is mainly due to the absence of instrumental correction

we used remote sensing and geographic information system to extracted coastlines of the yellow river delta from muti-temporal landsat tm / etm + images ( 1989 ~ 2009 ) , and analyzed the length and area variations of the yellow river delta .
the shape and length of the coastline in the yellow river delta had significantly changed since 1989 . coastal erosion occurred in the diaokou estuary area where the shoreline was not protected by dam .
the whole coastline in qingshuigou area extended seaward because some parts of it suffered from erosion .
coastline in shenxiangou area changed little because most parts of it were protected by dam .
the area of the yellow river delta increased from 1989 to 2009 , though it decreased from 2006 to 2009 .
the annual average of area that erosion occurred or siltation changed from small to large .
the yellow river delta was in expansion in the last 20 years . but from 2006 to 2009 , the area of the yellow river delta was decreased and more area had been in erosion or siltation status .
discharge and sediment concentration of the yellow river , precipitation and water diversion were main factors that influenced the area change of the yellow river delta . artificial dams were able to resist the invasion of sea wave and to maintain the stability of coastline .
the result of this work is contributed to the management and reservation of coastal environment

the upper yellow river basin ( uyrb ) is an important water conservation area .
however , the increasing annual mean temperature exerts great impacts on the water resources here . in this study , soil and water assessment tool ( swat ) was selected to set up a hydrological model in the uyrb and model calibration and validation were performed .
then daily precipitation , maximum and minimum air temperature data series at each station , generated by the statistical downscaling method ( sdsm ) , were inputted to drive the swat model to analyze the spatio-temporal characteristics of runoff during the future periods ( 2046-2065 and 2081-2100 ) under three climate scenarios including csiro , inm and mri.two emission scenarios ( sres a2 and sres b1 ) were also included .

the maximum values for annual mean runoff , r10 and r90 under climate change scenarios downscaled from csiro are obviously greater than that under inm , with the runoff driven by mri in between . the maximum and minimum of annual mean runoff , r10 and r90 would appear under the combined scenarios of csiro-a2 and inm-b1 respectively .
in both of the future periods , the results generally show decreasing trends for q10 under most of the climate change scenarios ( except the combined scenarios of inm-a2 and mri-b1 ) , while exhibite decreasing trends for q90 under all climate change scenarios .
in csiro , mri and inm downscaling climate change scenarios , spatial distribution of the average mean runoff for two future periods is more consistent with the baseline period , i. e. the runoff is large in the upstream area but small in downstream area ;
while the annual mean runoff in all climate change scenarios is smaller than that in the baseline period .

during the third chinare arctic expedition in summer 2008,33 days of current profile , near bottom sea water temperature and salinity data in central chukchi sea were collected by a mooring system ( cn-1 ) .
the observed data shows that near bottom water temperature has two rapid and significant changes during the observation .
ctd ( conductivity temperature depth ) data along r-section collected in this expedition , noaa ( national oceanic and atmospheric administration ) avhrr ( advanced very high resolution radiometer ) sst ( sea surface temperature ) and noaa sea surface wind data are used to analyze the rapid and significant temperature changes .
the results showed that water temperature changes rapidly at not only the bottom layer but also the upper layer . the rapid temperature changes are caused by the movement of temperature front . the movement consists of two parts , northward movement and swing in the direction of north-south .
the northward movement is related to climate characteristics , and the swing is related to synoptic characteristics

the yellow river mouth sag is located in the southeastern part of the bohai bay basin , china . the large scale shallow water lacustrine delta developed in neogene became profitable geologic conditions for the formation of concealed hydrocarbon reservoirs in this area .
the authors take the sequence sq1as an example , totally 10parasequence sets are divided to the sequence sq1of lower member of minghuazhen formation in block b34of the yellow river mouth sag .
lithologic statistics show that the lithology is dominated by sandstone and mudstone . thick sandstones are mainly distributed in pss1and pss10 , while thin-bedded sandstones mainly developed in other parasequence sets . the developing character of sandstones is related with where they are developed in the same sequence .
the studies include root mean square ( rms ) amplitude in different parasequence sets and well lithology , one-dimensional forward simulation of 7kinds of lithology associations . the results indicate that lithology and its association are correspondent to the amplitude as follows : strong amplitude corresponds to thick sandbodies , weak amplitude corresponds to non-development of sandbodies , and medium amplitude corresponds to a large set of mudstone intercalated with medium-thin-bedded sandstone .
the fine description of sandbodies was made taking the pss1as an example .
it is quite difficult to quantitatively identify the thickness of sandstone although the relationship between lithology and amplitude is established . as a result , the thickness of sandstone is qualitatively determined according to the amplitude
the research of some core , logging , seismic data from quantou formation in sanzhao sag has been finished and some geological ideas have been got , that is , the provenance of sanzhao sag was located in the north and southwest of songliao basin during the period of quantou formation , and the geological conditions were favorable for the formation of the large-scale shallow delta : the basement sank stably and the palaeotopography was gentle and smooth slope ;
the physical weathering was strong due to the arid palaeoclimate ( up to 37 ℃ ) ;
the lake level changed cyclically because of two cycles of palaeoclimate change from arid to humid ; the lake water was shallow less than 10meters and lake level changed obviously .
the shallow delta of sanzhao sag has obvious characteristics , that is the finer grain size , plenty of sedimentary structures formed by strong hydropower , wide purple mudstone with lots of bioturbation structure , several non-continuous normal cycles wertically , imbricated progradation seismic facies , large scale sandbody distribution with low percentage of sandstone to mudstone , and very unique distributary channels with few mouth bars .
the sedimentation of the shallow delta was controlled by the climate change .
when it was dry , the lake shrank , resulting in branched delta and branched distributary channels which were broad and shallow ;
the length of channels was more than 20km , the width from 800to 1 800m , the average thickness of individual layer was 2.3meters , and the average percentage of sandstone in strata was 35 % .
when it was wet , the lake expanded , the river branched off diverted frequently due to the lake water obstruction , formed reticular distributary channels that were narrow and deep , the length of the channel was less than 15km , the width from 500to 1 600m , the average thickness of individual layer was 2.8m , and the average percentage of sandstone in strata was 40 % .
therefore , the sandbodies of distributary channels are widely distributed , overlapped vertically , and continued laterally , and form favorable lithologic reservoirs

it was found that bionic coupling bits have higher drilling efficiency than ordinary drill bits by study .
on the one hand , bionic coupling bits with higher pressure on the bottom lip surface ;
on the other hand , it improves the cooling condition . so it has a good prospect in drilling engineering .
in this paper , the numerical simulation software ansys was used to analyze the impact of the convex and non-smooth surface on the performance of diamond bit .
comparison was made on the process of drill bits sliding friction on the rock surface with certain pressure under 4 different non-smoothness conditions .
analysis was made mainly on the variation of rock &apos;s equivalent stress , contact friction stress and contact pressure on the bottom lip surface of bit .
the convex and non-smooth surface can increase the service life and drilling efficiency of drill bit
based on the detailed observation and description of the macroscopic and microcosmic features , the development periods of the fractures , and formation time of effective fractures are studied in this paper by cathodeluminescence and carbon and oxygen isotope analyzing of fracture fillings .
the results show that there are 6 stages of fracture development identified in qinglong formation , southern jiangsu area . the fractures of first stage are stylolites , which developed during the early period of qinglong formation .
the fractures of second stage developed during the early indosinian-yanshanian , which are filled by calcites and with weak oil show .
the third stage fractures developed during early yizheng movement , which are half-filled by calcite and with abundant oil show .
the fourth stage fractures are stylolites , which developed during middle yizheng movement .
the fifth stage fractures developed during the early period of sanduo movement , which were filled by calcites .
the sixth stage fractures developed during yancheng period , which were unfilled .
the third stage fractures are the most effective fractures with rich oil show and cavities .
the tectonic stress field of early yizheng movement should be an important factor in the predicition of effective fractures in qinglong formation
due to the topographic effect of the tibetan plateau and its vicinity , some small but strong high and low pressure systems often occur on the isobaric levels of the lower atmosphere by extrapolation , and the real systems cannot be reflected clearly .
it can be used in the same way as the geopotential used on p coordinate .
as an example , a eastward moving tibetan plateau vortex is analyzed .
the results show some small but low and high systems always exist over the tibetan plateau due to extrapolation in the sea level pressure field , but at σ = 0.995 level , the process of the eastward moving tibetan plateau vortex coupling with the southeast vortex at lower levels can be depicted well by the distribution of  e , and these artificial systems in the tibetan plateau disappear .
therefore , the weather system near the surface of tibetan plateau can be analyzed well with the analysis method of equivalent isobaric geopotential height .
on the other side , the distribution of  e can link the synoptic pattern over the tibetan plateau with that in its lower reaches , which is favorable to reveal how the systems over the plateau impact the weather in the lower reaches
mid-deep lacustrine organic-rich shales in member 2 of the liushagang formation ( ls2 ) are the most important high-quality source rock in the beibuwan basin .
these dark-grey or-brown shales with developed lamellation contain abundant non-marine dinoflagellate , rugasphaera and leiosphaeridia fossils , they are rich in organic matter , with toc content ranging between 3.07 % ~ 10.35 % , type ii1 and i kerogen and pr / ph ratios varying from 0.6 to 2.5 .
the shales are characterized by a high abundance of 4-methyl steranes that are probably related to certain dinoflagellates thriving in lakes , relatively abundant pentacyclic triterpanes , tricyclic diterpanes and tetracyclic terpanes but a very tiny amount of oleanane indicative of terrigenous higher-plant input , and a &quot; v &quot; -shaped distribution of c27 , c28 and c29 regular steranes . all these characteristics indicated that the organic matter in those shales was mainly of algal origin .
the data of various algal fossils , especially plenty of non-marine dinoflagellates and amorphous organic macerals suggested that they were formed in an anoxic and stratified environment of mid-deep brackish lakes in humid climate , where organic-rich shales of the upper ls2 occurred at the top of a high-stand system tract and those of the lower ls2 were distributed at the bottom of a transgressive system tract .

the results show that the reservoir has characteristics of low compositional maturity , low structure maturity , high content of filler , main original interparticle pores as reservoir space , low oil displacement efficiency , oil-water flowing of low permeability oil field , chlorite as reservoir clay minerals , obvious rock impact on reservoir and medium acid sensitivity , medium to weak water sensitivity
dedolomitization is very common in the strata , but it is still in dispute about its formation environment , influencing factors , mechanisms , and the role in reservoir and so on .
the recognition marks was analyzed , and detailed classification of dedolomitization from 3 aspects was given : retaining the original crystal form or not , occurrence mode and forming environment , the manifestation in diagenesis .
dedolomitization can occur in various environments , from the near-surface settings to shallow burial and deep burial environments , even in hypergene deposit and lacustrine environments .
the factors influencing dedolomitization mainly include the dolostones , chemical constituents and physical properties , degree of order , fluid characters ( concentration of so2-4 , ca / mg ratio , temperature , ph and partial pressure of co2 ) and fe content of the dolostone .
cathodeluminescence and geochemical analysis can be used to study the dedolomitization mechanism in near-surface , mixed seawater and freshwater , burial and other environments .
dedolomitization process can be divided into two steps , including dissolution of dolomite and the precipitation of calcite . only the first step occurs to form the rhomb-moldic pore ;
only one step happens or the two the two steps take place in different order .
dedolomitization mostly begins from the core of the dolomite or the interface between the core and the rim , because there are deficits during the growth process and the ca content is high .
dedolomitization can be considered as a kind of process that the mg2 + is gradually released .
the studies of calcite-dolomite-solution system can help to investigate the transforming condition between calcite and dolomite and the influencing factors .
the near-surface dedolomitization is generally relevant to the dissolution of gypsum or anhydrite and the meteoric water of vadose zone and phreatic zone .
it is confirmed that the laterally continuous distribution of dedolomitization can indicate unconformity .
the study of dedolomitization products can reflect the diagenetic stages and the source of the fluid .
dedolomitization can enlarge the modic pore and inter-crystal pore and improve the reservoir quality , but there is close relationship between the increasing porosity of dedolomitization and latter eluviation .
without the latter leaching , maybe the late burial dedolomitization relevant to calcite precipitation will destroy the primary pores
according to the grey topological prediction method , a series of models were established to be used for the annual runoff prediction in dayu river basin .
the annual runoff from 1955 to 1999 was used to calibrate their parameters and that from 2000 to 2006 was used to check the models .
for the check results , only relative error of the year of 2006 is up to 40.3 % , others were less than 20.6 % . so the models could be used to carry out the runoff prediction .
annual runoff from 2007 to 2016 was predicted by the models .
then the moving average method and mann-kendall test method were used to analyze the trend characteristics of the annual runoff series from 1955 to 2006 and from 1955 to 2016 , respectively .
results show that the two runoff series have a non-outstanding decreasing trend , but the trend of the latter ( 1955 to 2016 ) is more than that of the former ( 1955 to 2006 ) .
thus we can draw a conclusion that the annual runoff of the dayu river has a decreasing trend on a whole
the analysis on one cyclonic eddy observed in the middle of the ls in 1994 , suggests that the sea level anomaly from the northwestern pacific propagates into the scs through the ls after coupling with the original signal in the ls.the time-longitude diagram implies that the sea level anomaly signals become discontinuous near the ls ( 121 ° -122 ° e ) when they propagate westward .
after applying the band-pass filter to the sea level anomaly data in the section 21 ° n , 116 ° -140 ° e with the periods of 1-3 month , 3-6 month and 330-390 d , one can conclude that the signals from the northwestern pacific propagating into the scs through the ls get different blocked , have different westward propagation velocity and have different forcing mechanisms for different period bands
amplitude preservation has long been an important issue in seismic processing , great progress has been taken to satisfy the demand of seismic exploration especially for structural formation , but for lithologic prospecting , there still exist some pitfalls such as stretching effect in both nmo and migration , cdp scattering effect in cmp of dip reflection , dispersion as well as smearing effect in migration , and so on .
to settle these effects on reflection , a technology called tracing reflection along layer ( tralayer ) is designed to gather traces with same crp ( common reflection point ) , by which an one by one relationship between reflector point and reflection is established and snell &apos;s law is stand .
crp gather is acquired by tralayer , it could be used to accurate avo inversion ; crp stack is acquired by tralayer , and it could be used to precise interpretation .
by tralayer , physical characteristic of reflection might be reserved and its delicate spatial variation might be presented compared to traditional processing
to improve the tidal prediction accuracy , the error correction of a regional tidal model is carried out using a local model approach based on chaos theory where sufficient tidal measurement data were available .
as the examples , for one month ( december-2007 ) , the local model correction can remove as much as 74.7 % of root mean square error ( rmse ) at chongwu measurement station and 60.5 % at xiamen station for the prediction horizon t = 2 h , and remove around 50 % rmse at above two stations for the prediction horizon t = 24 h
based on the measured tide gauge records at 25 stations in the zhujiang delta , the periodic oscillations and secular trends of water level series were studied with power spectra analysis and fourier transformation analysis .
the power spectra analysis of monthly mean time series reveals that there were several predominant periods of water level change , varying from 0.3 a to 11.7 a .
results from linear regression of low-passed time series which were the outcome of fourier transform process suggest that the water level of river network of zhujiang delta was rising in general , and the rate of water level change generally ascended as shifting from the top of the delta to the outlets of the zhujiang river .
the rates of water level change of 25 tide gauge stations differ from-3.8 mm / a to 3.7 mm / a , and the secular trend of seven stations among them was descending , which was largely due to large-scale disordered sand excavation in the upper reaches of the xijiang and beijiang river network .
analysis on the change in the rates of water level change of different periods indicates that large-scale sand excavation in the river network which led to bed scour and deepening resulted in the significant fluctuation of water level , and even reversed the secular trend of water level change

the example shows its decision-making assistance and strong platform portability
to solve the lack of equipment that can directly measure formation water &apos;s ion content in the condition of high temperature and high pressure at home and abroad .
the static experiment for test ion content and scaling amount in formation fluid under the condition of high temperature and high pressure was made .
pvt analysis for the actual gas field &apos;s fluid of high temperature and high pressure and ion content detection experiments were carried on in this paper .
water content in gas , amount of gas dissolved in water and the icon formation content in water are tested , scaling amount of formation fluid was firmed . the change rule of gas and water &apos;s phase state and ionic content have been studied comprehensively , the internal relation influence was analyzed .
the results show that quantity of dissolved gas in water reduces with formation pressure decreasing , the evaporation water to natural gas formation intensifies , electrolyticion &apos;s concentration and salinity increases , and the scaling trends increase .
in certain low pressure and high temperature conditions , the inorganic salt in formation fluid began scaling . the scaling quantity increases with experiment pressure increasing , and decreases with the experimental temperature decreasing .
scaling quantity of the under actual production condition is lower than that of the degassing formation water , and change trend of scaling quantity with temperature and pressure is more obvious

a set of marine carbonate rocks interbedded with clastic rock was deposited in the early paleozoic in the ordos area , with huge thickness and various sedimentary types .
according to characteristics of sedimentary sequence , petrology , sedimentary structure and palaeontology , four depositional systems can be distinguished in the lower paleozoic in the ordos including coast , carbonate rock platform , platform margin and deepwater slope-trough , which can be subdivided into several subfacies and microfacies .
for each facies , its sedimentary characteristics , spatial and temporal distribution were summarized .
based on these studies , the lithofacies palaeogeography maps of the lower paleozoic in the ordos were compiled by each age .
the early cambrian only formed a set of mud-sand flat and mud-dolostone flat sediments around the southwestern margin of the ordos land .
followed the marine transgression spread in the middle cambrian , the central-eastern part of the ordos was gradually transformed from sand-mud flat to restricted platform-open platform sediments , and developed platform edge to deepwater trough sediments in the western margin .
since the late cambrian marine regression , the central-eastern part of the ordos was changed to restrictive platform dolostone flat sediments , but the deepwater slope-trough facies was still developed in the western margin .
to the early ordovician , the main body of the ordos became a uniform palaeoland with mud-dolostone flat and dolomitic-limestone flat sediments around its southeastern margin .
then a massive transgression in the middle ordovician led to an extensive shallow epicontinental deposits in the ordos . the northern shaanxi depression formed a gypsum salt lake , and developed restrictive platform-open platform sediments outside it .
at the late middle ordovician , the southwestern margin began to develop platform foreslope-deepwater trough facies sediments .
the late ordovician caledonian movement uplifted the main ordos as a land , and formed a narrow sea continuing deposit in the southwestern margin of the ordos . the sedimentary facies was quickly changed from carbonate rock platform to deepwater slope-trough , and developed some reefs in the southern margin of ordos , indicating the epicontinental marginal rimmed platform deposit
the ordos has gigantically thick paleozoic marine strata .
the carbon and oxygen isotopes of the ordovician carbonate rocks in the ordos are less modified by post-depositional diagenesis , and thus provide helpful insights into the original ocean .
the δ13c values of the ordovician carbonate rocks in the ordos range from -7.30 ‰ to 2.26 ‰ with a mean value of -0.30 ‰ and the δ18o varies between -13.14 ‰ and -1.94 ‰ , averaging at -6.38 ‰ , which indicate the carbon and oxygen isotopes of the ordovician in the ordos are comparable to those of the global ordovician .
spatially , the δ13c shows a decreasing trend , indicating shoaling in water-depth from the western margin of the ordos , to the southern margin and then to the eastern margin .
temporally , the δ13c gradually increases , showing that sea level rose from the early to the late ordovician , with a significant positive excursion between the middle and late ordovician that is indicated by increase in mean δ13c value from -0.36 ‰ in the majiagou formation to 0.15 ‰ in the pingliang formation and then to 0.68 ‰ in the beiguoshan formation .
sea level change suggested by carbon isotope distribution is consistent with the evolution of sedimentary facies .
the positive excursion of carbon isotopes in the middle and late ordovician in the ordos indicates relative high productivity and organic carbon burial , which is of important petroleum geological significance , reflecting the pingliang formation , wulalike formation and beiguoshan formation in the southwestern margin as the most important and efficient hydrocarbon source rocks of the lower paleozoic in the ordos
magnetic and multibeam data were collected from dayang no .
1 first world cruise at mid atlantic ridge .
the interpretation of magnetic anomalies and bathymetric data shows the geophysical characteristics of hydrothermal plumes at the logatchev vent field . logatchev vent site is situated on the eastern inner flank of the rift valley and between the high value of positive and negative anomalies .
nww-see and ns trending fault not only control basement depth and upwelling-sag , but also dose the distribution of ultramafic rock and heat source .
it is suggest that the logatchev hydrothermal field is associated with ultramafic-hosted , off-axis location with detachment faulting , oceanic core complex , abundant gravitational landslides
based on the detailed investigation of hydrogeological condition in liulin spring catchment , hydrochemical types and zoning regularity of liulin karstic water were systematically studied , and its formation and evolution rule were analyzed .
the results show that a ) liulin karstic groundwater is high quality fresh water with low salinity , its advantage cationic are ca2 + , mg2 + , and advantage anionic is hco-3 ;
b ) the hydrochemical types of the groundwater are successively hco3-ca · mg , hco3-ca → so4 · hco3-ca , hco3 · so4-ca · mg → cl · so4-na · ca , cl · so4-na from recharge area to deep buried area , the change process accords with typical hydrochemical evolution characteristics of arid and semi-arid climate region

understanding the chemical characteristics of groundwater in the yellow river delta is very important . it can provide a useful reference for the development and construction of the yellow river delta high-efficiency ecological economic zone and ecological regulation in the lower yellow river .
based on partitioning the sediment environment and the recharge-runoff-discharge system , we studied the hydrochemical features and causes of shallow groundwater in the yellow river delta by mathematical statistics and geostatistics , piper diagram , ion ratios and so on .
following results are obtained : ① major cations and anions such as na + , mg2 + , ca2 + , cl- , so2-4 , hco-3and tds concentrations range from 0.1-25.0 g · l-1,3.6-3 815.0 mg · l-1,5.6-3 377.0 mg · l-1,0.1-45.1 g · l-1,24.2-4 947.0 mg · l-1,62.6-850.0 mg · l-1 and 0.4-80.7 g · l-1 .
average ion concentrations further indicate that cl- , na + and tds concentrations are high while hco-3 , co2-3 and k + concentrations are very low in the study area .
② the cl-and tds concentrations of shallow groundwater possess conspicuous directional spatial variability and gradually increase along the groundwater flow direction , showing that cl-is the most critical ion of shallow groundwater .
③ from the recharge area to the discharge area , shallow groundwater changes from the na + -mg2 + -ca2 + -cl-so2-4 facies to the na + -mg2 + -ca2 + -cl- , mg2 + -na + -ca2 + -cl-and na + -mg2 + -cl-facies , finally evolves into na + -cl-facies in the coast .
④ ion ratios indicate that the following main hydrochemical processes are inferred to control the shallow groundwater chemical composition : mixing , evaporation concentrating , mineral dissolution , cation exchange and adsorption and human activities .
these findings strongly suggest that changes of the yellow river water course and seawater intrusion are key drivers to form the chemical characteristics of shallow groundwater in the region
in order to make out the relation between fracturing characteristics of miaoxibei depression and hydrocarbon accumulation , the structural interpretation and drilling data have been used to carry out the systematical analysis of the geometry features and evolution characteristics of the cenozoic fracturing .
the results indicate the miaoxibei depression has undergone the evolution processes of rift , depression and reversal .
in different development stages , the singular and multiple tectonic stress such as stretching , strike-slipping and reversal have been undergone .
the obvious fracturing characteristics show layered differences and interaction cutting laterally , and demonstrate various combination styles in space distribution .
different fracturing systems have different control on hydrocarbon accumulation . the structural framework and source rock are controlled by the basement fractures , the main traps are controlled by the cover faulting . two suits of fracturing systems together formed the migration channel and the superimposed area on the plane is the favorable hydrocarbon migration and accumulation area
2036 landslides were triggered by the 2010 yushu earthquake , in a total area of 1.194km2.
the landslide area percent ( lap ) and the landslide number density ( lnd ) are selected as two indices for the susceptibility analysis of landslide impact factors .
the impact factors of landslides include the earthquake impact factors such as the epicenter , the macro-epicenter , the main co-seismic surface fault-rupture , the peak ground acceleration ( pga ) , and the co-seismic displacement ; the topography impact factors such as the elevation , the slope angle , the slope aspect , the slope curvature , the slope position , and the drainages ;
the geology impact factors such as the lithology and the faults ; and other impact factors such as the roads and the normalized difference vegetation index ( ndvi ) .
the results show that : ( 1 ) both lap and lnd have strong positive correlations with the distance from the main co-seismic surface fault-rupture , and also have positive correlations with the macro-epicenter and co-seismic displacement except for individual classifications , but the correlations between the landslide occurrences and the epicenter , and pga are not clear-cut .
( 2 ) the greater the slope angle , the higher the probability of landslide occurrence ;
the elevation less than 4000m sees a high susceptibility to landslide occurrences ;
it can be found that the slopes facing ne , e , and se see relatively higher lap and lnd values than other directions ;
the higher the slope position , the higher the landslide susceptibility except for flat slope ;
landslides have positive correlations with the distance from drainages ;
rough slopes are more prone to landslide occurrence than smooth slopes .
( 3 ) the stratums of q4 al-pl ( alluvium , fluvial deposits , gravel ) , n ( quartz sandstone , breccia ) , and t3kn1 ( feldspathic sandstone , siltstone , slate , limestone , phyllite ) see concentrated landslide activities , the correlation between the landslide occurrences and the faults is not clear-cut .
( 4 ) the closer to roads and the more sparse of the vegetation , the more susceptibility to landslide occurrences

dissimilatory fe ( ⅲ ) reduction is an important iron cycling process , and the content of micro-bially reducible fe ( ⅲ ) ( mr-fe ( ⅲ ) ) is an important parameter to characterize dissimilatory fe ( ⅲ ) re-duction potential and to quantify the highly reactive fe ( ⅲ ) .
in this study , hydroxylamine hydrochloride extraction was used to quantify contents and depth profiles of mr-fe ( ⅲ ) in jiaozhou bay sediments at se-lected sites .
the results show that mr-fe ( ⅲ ) contents in the surface sediments are in the range of 7.82 - 27.9 μmol / g , being a portion of highly reactive fe and only a small fraction of total fe .
the mr-fe ( ⅲ ) contents have no apparent correlation with the clay fraction due probably to wastewater discharges to the bay .
, rapid chemical reduction ) .
for the semi-closed jiaozhou bay with limited self-adjusting capacity , a further study on the relative contribution of dissimlatory fe ( ⅲ ) reduc-tion to organic matter oxidation in the sediments , and its effects on cycling of sulfur , nutrients and heavy metals is of particular importance
based on the dynamic analysis of free-hanging risers , an improved ant colony optimization ( aco ) was proposed for optimizations of accelerations of equal-length paths .
via the improved aco , an optimized motion scheme for the upper end was obtained .
under the optimized motion scheme , the distance from the lower end to wellhead was effectively decreased and the re-entry took less time , which made the re-entry operation more convenient .
in this paper , the different dynamic response and riser shape changes under optimized motion scheme and ordinary motion scheme were compared .
the results demonstrate that the motion optimizations of the improved aco is effective , and the optimized motion scheme obtained via improved aco could make the re-entry more convenient
swat is a physically explicit distributed hydrologic model , which could simulate hydrological processes such as surface runoff , snowmelt runoff and infiltration with geographic information system ( gis ) . the surface runoff component in swat is implemented by using the scs curve number and snowmelt is calculated by a relatively simple , empirical degree-day method .
those approaches work well in humid and semi-humid areas where precipitation dominantly controls runoff . in cold and arid regions , for example , in a case study in the heihe river basin ( hrb ) of northwest china , however , it revealed those implementations cannot represent the effects of snowmelt in springs and thus impact surface runoff simulations .
at large , snowmelt in such areas is underestimated and more discrepancies are consequently introduced to the overall simulation accuracy .
this paper proposes a coupling approach to improve the simulation of snowmelt by integrating fasst snowmelt to swat . in this approach , when the snowmelt begins to be calculated in swat , it will call fasst snowmelt to calculate , return its value to the swat corresponding variable and continue remainder swat logics . the technical implementation is presented in detail . an application to the upper mountainous hrb is set up to test its performance .
there are abundant snow falls in upper hrb in winters and snowmelt is the primary water source to river in springs that cannot be simulated well by original swat . the improvements in comparison to the original were examined from three aspects , namely , streamflow , snowmelt runoff and surface runoff contribution to streamflow . both snowmelt and surface runoff estimates with the coupled model were increased so that streamflow estimate was more close to that observed .
examination of surface runoff contribution to streamflow also supports its feasibility in estimating snowmelt by the coupled approach . moreover , by using optimized parameter sets , the monthly streamflow simulation accuracy in the validation period of 2000-2009 can be up to 0.83 in nse . the results confirm the applicability of the swat-fasst coupled approach in cold and alpine watersheds where snowmelt should be taken into account and suggest its significance in improving the simulations in such areas
to reduce the exploration and production cost and the engineering investment scale , we make use of the experiences from many field practices at home and abroad made by the geological exploration and development research institute of cnpc chuanqing drilling engineering co .
, ltd . we are exploring two ways of integrating geological studies with engineering operation to improve the whole economic efficiency of oil and gas industry engineering services companies .
one is called the &quot; cooperation-type &quot; service : the operator is responsible for deci- ding upon the geological targets and schemes for the cooperative zone , while the contractor for practicing the partial contracted operation .
the other one is called the &quot; epcc-led &quot; service ( epcc stands ~ or engineering , procurement , construction and commissioning ) : the operator is in charge of deciding upon the production target , while the contractor is of practicing the overall contracting from geological schemes to engi- neering service .
the above two ways of service have already applied to many overseas projects like the right bank of the amu darya river , turkmenistan , kam in kazakhstan , etc . , as well as in domestic projects like the sulige , etc .
obviously good results from the above projects are summed up in the aspects of realizing high-efficiency development of oil and gas fields , improving the reserves producing degree , scaling up the production , shortening the production circle , mitigating the investment risk , and so on .
in the end , it is suggested that the two ways of service should not only be helpful for reducing the cost and improving the efficiency , but be in favor of the intensive development of engineering services companies , thereby to increase their overall economic benefit
in the paper , according to the complexity of semantic association features in the geographic multi-modal network , the semantic association was extended and eccnm was established , which can support the semantic representation of complex association of network element in multi-leveled geographic network .
according to the limit of the geometrical snapping model , an approach to mod- eling , semantic as main and geometry as supplementary , was put forward . the experimental results showed that ten million of elements scale networks using this hybrid algorithm could save 60 % of the time cost than using a network method of pure geometry , and the topological correctness would better meet the needs of practical application

jinping first stage hydropower station was taken as the research area to study the stress field characteristics of a valley slope with complex geological structure in high geo-stress area .
according to the analysis on jinping valley stress field features , the valley slope stress was classified into four zones , namely , the stress-releasing zone , stress-interim zone , stress-concentrating zone and stress-stable zone .
the tectonic stress and the morphology of valley shape were two important factors that cause high stress at the bottom of valley .
the faults in valley significantly influence the stress field characteristics . the valley stress was more easily unloaded through the fault tending outward , which was one of the reason for the unloading limitation altitude was lower in left bank than right bank and deep unloading zone in left bank slope .
the slope range influenced by geo-stress state adjustment during the river cutting was wider in right bank than in left bank .
the rapid unloading because of river rapid cutting was one of the reasons that induced th
by using the ncep / ncar reanalysis data , conventional observation data , radar echo , a rainstorm process in henan province from 4 to 5 august 2012 is analyzed .
the result shows that the circulation situation in the middle and high latitude provided favorable conditions for the strom .
the convergence line , trough on the 700 hpa , the ground dry line , boundary layer terrain lifting and the heat maintaining provide unstable stratification convergence uplift and trigger condition for the storm .
for the reason that the typhoon damrey move northward slowly by the blocking effect of the subtropical high , two strands of airflow merge in the confluence area of the typhoon and subtropical high , plenty of water vapor was provided to the henan .
because of the effecting of boundary layer terrain and the strong convergence near the 600 hpa level , the precipitation of linzhou reached 100 mm in one hour
the upper sinian zhengmuguan and tuerkeng formations in the helan mountains have been tra- ditionally interpreted as glacial and deep-water deposits , respectively .
our study of these stratigraphic u- nits at two new sections shows that glacial deposits of the zhengmuguan formation were reworked by gravity flows , and that the calcareous cements in the zhengmuguan formation were formed subsequently during the deposition of the overlying dolostone and in warm environments .
the tuerkeng formation ex- hibits significant lithostratigraphic and facies variation .
this study shows that the zhengmuguang and tuerkeng formations have a complex depositional and diagenetic history that can be unraveled only through careful investigations of temporal and spatial variation patterns
douhe reservoir is a large water conservancy project for flood protection and water supply . its stable operation is of great significance .
in order to analyze the condition of the settlement deformation and the stability of the douhe main dam , the surface settlement points were monitored regularly by using the swiss wildn3 precision level based on precision leveling method .
the result demonstrated that the settlement of the main dam of douhe reservoir was tending towards stability by the year of 2007 through analyzing the high-precise leveling monitoring data , the settlement rate chart , the cumulative settlement chart and the dam stability criteria
ledong 22 1 / 15-1 are two large medium to-shallow gas fields of structural-lithological type controlled by diaper dome anti clines .
in order to understand its unique gas accumulation patterns of the diaper structure , we analyzed the gas play conditions in the study area .
the structure in which the ledong 22 1 and 15 1 gas fields occur is located in the hydrocarbon kitchen of the central de pression with favorable source rock conditions and the diapiric rising providing space for gas accumulation .
the deep high-pressure composite geotemperature-geopressure system drives gas migration into the shallow normal temperature-pressure system .
then , natural gas migrates vertically along the faults and microfractures related to diapiric rising into shallow littoral sandstone and tempes- tite reservoirs .
according to the spatial combination of the diaper structure with natural gas reservoirs , and adopting such research methods as kinetics of hydrocarbon generation and carbon isotopes , this paper discussed the relationship between the diaper structure and gas accumulation .
on one hand , the diaper structure determines the spatial combination of natural gas which accumulates in the structural lithological traps on the top and two sides of the diaper structure .
on the other hand , the development and evolution of the diaper structure has the genetic linkage and a coupling relation with hydrocarbon generation , migration and accumulation .
it was con cluded that the gas reservoirs in the study area are featured by late enrichment , mixed sources and episodic accumulation , and that the hydrocarbon accumulation process can be divided into 3 stages which corresponds with the episodic activity of the diaper struc ture

the nanhuan system examined and adopted in 2000 by the third chinese committee of stratig- raphy , which is a chronostratigraphic unit of system level between the sinian ( ediacaran ) and qingbaikouan system .
its strata range is the original lower series of sinian , which includes the neoproterozoic gla- cial deposits .
the name of &quot; nanhuan &quot; comes from the earliest named &quot; south china greater ice age &quot; by mr liu hong-yun .
in recent years , so many shrimp zircon u-pb ages are obtained from the nanhuan system in south china and xinjiang , together with the chemical evidences of the cold climate found from the liantuo formation and the equivalent detrital rock , the definition of the nanhuan lower boundary is determined to appear the first glacial diamictite or the equivalent of the clastic rocks with cold weathering sedi- ments in neoproterozoic .
based on isotopic ages and chemical stratigraphic date obtained from the nanhuan system in south china and xinjiang and the stratigraphic sequences of glaciations or cold events , the nanhuan system is divided into the lower , middle and upper series .
the time limit of the lower series is 725 -780 ma , the middle series is 6604725 ma and the upper series is 635-660 ma .
they respectively correspond to the global neoproterozoic kaigas glaciation ( ≈ 770-735 ma ) , sturtian glaciation ( ≈ 715-680 ma ) , marinoan glaciation ( ≈ 660-635 ma ) .
according to the current isotopic age informations , the lower boundary age of the nanhuan system is determined for 780 mathe age of upper boundary , corresponding to the lower sinian boundary is 635 ma

and in the retrieval process , it used the spatial similarity algorithm which is based on the gis spatial analysis function to search the similar historical typhoon .
on that basis , it reasoned the attribute information of forecast typhoon and calculated the attribute similarity , so as to improve the accuracy of the similarity .
then this paper used genetic algorithm to reason the relief supplies information for forecasting typhoon , which would provide auxiliary support services for natural hazard reduction decision-making
traditional coordinate system transformation methods do not consider the observation error of control points in the original coordinate system .
to consider the observation error which has an affect on the coordinate system transformation , the paper applied total least squares ( tls ) to achieve plane coordinate system conversion .
measured data were applied to test the feasibility of the meth- od in plane coordinate system conversion , and comparison with traditional least squares ( is ) was carried out finally . the result veri- fied the effectiveness of the proposed method
tectonic movement plays a key role in controlling hydrocarbon distribution of the bieshikent depression and its adjacent ar eas in the amu-darya basin . however , a poor understanding of the genetic mechanism of structures impedes petroleum exploration there .
through structural interpretation with seismic data and regional balanced section analysis and in combination with drilling data and reservoir characteristics , this paper studied the tectonic evolution and its impacts on hydrocarbon distribution in the study area .
the following conclusions were obtained . the tectonic deformation there are featured by the zonation of being strong in the east and weak in the west and layering above and below evaporate beds .
the permo-triassic extensional tectonic movement led to the develop- ment of basement fault blocks and paleohighs , while the post-paleogene , compressional tectonic movement led to the formation of ji- saer folded uplift and bieshikent foreland depression . the compressive stress field became weakened gradually from the jisaer moun- tain to the foreland depression , and had dextral compresso-shear characteristics .
the compressive tectonic movement resulted in the formation of structural traps dominated by compressive anticlines , overthrust anticlines and fault noses in the bieshikent depression and jisaer folded uplift zone . a large amount of tectoclases modified the carbonate reservoirs and destructed the seals in the northern part of the jisaer folded uplift zone .
on this basis , it is believed that exploration should focus on the faulted anticlinal traps in the bieshikent depression and jisaer folded uplift zone , and that the modified paleohighs and the intersection areas of two-stage faults be most favorable for oil and gas exploration

on the basis of the model , this paper applied the technologies of com- gis to develop a study of multimodal trip path analysis .
the results proved its feasibility
taking evolutive nanjing urban streets as the main study object , the paper combined with the actual landuse information to carry out the quantitive analysis and comparative study on the spatial structure evolution of nanjing old city zones in different typical historical periods based on spatial syntax with the traditional statistical and comparative analysis methods .
the callovian-oxfordian carbonate reservoirs in block a of the right bank of the amu darya river , turkmenistan , are featured by multiple types of carbonate rocks , strong reservoir heterogeneity , and a complex relationship between lithology and elec tric property , making it difficult to predict the quality and lateral distribution of the reservoirs .
based on the observation and analysis of core and cast thin section , the lithofacies were subdivided into granular micrite facies , micritic sparry grainstone facies and bioher mal limestone facies according to the degree of reservoir development .
the corresponding logging responses of these lithofacies were determined and their electrical properties were analyzed . then logging identification criteria were summarized for these lithofacies .
a series of mathematical analytical techniques such as main coordination analysis , wavelet analysis and multiple parameters progressive discrimination analysis were used to build a mathematical relationship model between lithofacies and logging facies , which can realize automatic identification of lithofacies with logging data .
the results showed that the xvm layer is dominated by micritic sparry grainstone facies and biohermal limestone facies , the xvp layer by well developed granular micrite facies and micritic sparry grain stone facies , and the xvac layer by granular micrite facies .
the xvm layer is the highest in reservoir quality , followed by the xvp and xvac layers .
reservoir quality prediction results obtained by using this method agree well with real test results with a coinci- dence rate over 80 %
as being a kind of nonrenewable resource , oil holds dominant position in energy field .

combined with yc13-4 gas field development project , this article introduces control system of subsea production system and studies master station of subsea control system and electric power unit of subsea control system .
it is hoped that this article can provide some reference for all colleagues who will participate in deep sea oil and gas field development project in the future
a dual nested hybrid coordinate ocean model ( hycom ) was used to simulate the climatically pacific ocean current system . the modeling results were compared with in-situ measurements and previ-ous studies , it showed that the model had a fine capacity in the simulation in this area .
the annually mean current field in the pacific was constructed with the modeling results , and quantitative analysis was con- ducted based on the qualitative analysis in the first place .
the source and replenishment of the major cur- rents were discussed : the source of the south equatorial current came from the peru current and the up-welling of the equatorial undercurrent ; the equatorial undercurrent originated from the return flow of the new guinea coastal current ; the eastern boundary currents in the north pacific had a relatively narrow flow range in the surface layer and a wider range in the subsurface layer ;
the subtropical countercurrent featured a two-core or even multiple-core structure in both hemispheres .
the seasonal variation of the cur- rent was analyzed , the source of the north equatorial countercurrent in winter and spring differed that in summer and autumn ; the surface layer of the north equatorial countercurrent featured seasonal disappear-ance ; the westwards intermediate layer of the equatorial current only existed in autumn and west of the international date line ;
there was a noticeable seasonal discrepancy of the current field in the west pacific , comparing that in summer and autumn with that in winter and spring
on the basis of field investigations , it was found that quaternary red clays in the ganzhou basin contain a small amount of angular clasts distributed as discontinuous bands .
particle size analysis of three red clay sections showed that the average contents of coarse silt ( 10-50μm ) were 29.14 % , 30.80 % , and 38.15 % , respectively .
the analyzed samples are rich in silts and clays and showed evidence for secondary weathering . by using x diffraction techniques , it was found that there were differences in mineral composi- tion and grain sizes between the red clays and underlying arenaceous shale .
pollen analysis indicates that there are some aquatic herbs in the huangjing ( hj ) red clay section . the quaternary red clays are distrib- uted mainly in terraces ii or iii in the zhangiiang river , gongiiang river , and ganjiang river .
thus , the quaternary red clays in the ganzhou basin were derived from pinnacled soil and weathering products , which was eroded by rivers and redeposited in basins . the earth crust was subsequently elevated and streams were trenched .
the quaternary red clays are presently distributed in the red hill about 100-200 m along rivers in the ganzhou area
this paper studied ree distribution characteristics and ecological effects of 52 surface soil samples collected from the wetlands of yeya lake .
the resuits indicated that ree contents in surface soil of this area ranged from 131.81 to 217.49 mg · kg ^ -1 , with an average of 173 . 87 mg · kg ^ -1 .
fractionation of ree was in larger extent , even the lowest fractionation reached 4.70 in dong xiaoying .
the 8eu value ranged 0.64 to 0.78 in the study area , meaning negative anomalies . the 8ce value ranged 0.95 to 0 . 99 , meaning without anomalies , matched the soil in the region which is a reducing environment .
correlation between 8ce and 8eu , 8ce and ∑ ree showed that the diagenesis of the impact was not obvious .
ree in the area had little correlation with ph , but a good correlation with toc . chondrite-normalized pattern of ree showed that the typical enrichment of light rees ( la to nd ) was relative to that of heavy rees ( er to lu ) . the graphic curve was right tilt .
in different vegetation areas , the average content of ∑ ree , lree and hree was in order of common cultivated land 〉 woodland 〉 reed 〉 grassland 〉 sediment .
how- ever , fractionation was in order of cultivated land 〉 woodland 〉 grassland 〉 sediment 〉 reed . the authors thus consider that the wetland environment and artificial have a larger influence on ree distribution and fractionation .
in the wetland environment , the ree cycle have taken a more important part in geochemica
based on the fact that wind field has some degree of spatial correlation , measure-correlate- predict ( mcp ) algorithms can use concurrent data from target sites and a nearby reference site to predict the wind resource at target sites for wind power development .
during last 15 years , over a dozen of mcp methods have been established , which differ in terms of overall approach , model definition , use of direc- tion sectors , length of data .
there are linear regression model , composite of wind speeds at two-site mod- el , vector regression method , composite of standard deviations of two datasets and so on . but mcp algorithms mentioned above can only predict wind speed of target site with the same alti- tude .
if the target site is higher or lower than the reference site too much , the result will be unreliable . so a new mcp method with height error revision is proposed based on data of two wind measurements , inclu- ding six-layer wind data in one year . the fitted equations of weibull parameters k and c as the function of height have been derived .
by means of fitted equations , the relationship between winds of high and low al- titude can be formulated .
so , a method for error reduction is presented .
at last , a set of performance comparison are carried out . the coefficient of correlation , the mean speed , the wind distribution and the correct annual energy production are selected as metrics at the target site , and a sample wind turbine power curve is analyzed . the mean and standard deviation of those esti- mates are used to characterize results .
results indicate that the new mcp method with height error revi- sion work much better than previous ones
due to the dramatic gradients of temperature ( up to above 400 ℃ ) , ph and chemicals , deep-sea hydrothermal vents have been the focus for studies of the origin and evolution of life on earth and the subseafloor hydrothermal living system is ideal for exploring the origin and evolution of deep-sea life .
in this study , the diversity of archaea was investigated at high temperature sediments and chimney from guaymas hydrothermal vent using cultured- independent technique .
environmental total dna were directly extracted and used for the quantification and construction of archaea 16s rrna gene libraries . a total of 79 and 80 clean sequences were obtained from the sediment and chimney samples .
quantitative pcr analysis revealed that the amounts of archaea present in the sediment and chimney were about 1.47 * 109 copies / g ( wet weight ) and 5.29 * 10s copies / g ( wet weight ) , respectively .
all the clone libraries had the coverage c value more than 80 % , the archaea diversity of sediment sample was higher than the chimney .
the compositions of archaea community were different between two samples , yet most of archaea belonged to the thermophilic / hyperthermophilic microorganism because of the high temperature environment .
while the euryarchaeota domain dominated the chimney sample , in which thermococcales ( 47.5 % ) , marine benthic group d ( mbgd ) / deep hydrothermal vent euryarchaeota 1 ( dhve 1 ) ( mbgd / dhve 1,30 % ) were the main components .
moreover , we found a new subgroup of mcg , named mcg-h , which might be a high-temperature specific group of mcg . therefore , this study will shed some lights on understanding the physiological functions and evolution of archaea
stable organic carbon isotopic composition ( δ13corg .
four samples for radio-carbon ( 14c ) dating were collected from depth of 54cm , 130cm , 190cm and 240cm , and the dating results indicated that the sampled profile do cover the lg and the holocene periods . magnetic susceptibility and δ13 crg. of the 165 loess samples have been measured indoor .
results is consistent with that from yuan bao profile located in southwestern part of the longxi loess plateau , while opposite to that from jing yuan profile with more negative values occurred in the holocene paleosol located in the northern part of the longxi loess plateau , which indicate that there still has some internal differences in c3 / c4 variations between different parts in the longxi loess plateau .
it seems the relative abundance of the c4 plants increased from the lg to the holocene in the southeastern and southwestern part of the longxi loess plateau .
however , in the northern part of the longxi loess plateau , it seems that this area was predominated by c3 plants not only during the lg , but also during the holocene .
many studies on carbon isotopic composition of modern c3 plants and its relationship conditions clearly demonstrated that there is a consistent negative correlation between carbon iso with environmental topes of modern c3 plants and the amount of precipitation .
if so , the organic carbon isotopes derived from vegetation composed of c3 plants or predominated by c3 plants should be a potential indicator of paleo-precipitation .
therefore , soil organic carbon isotopes from the longxi loess plateau , especially from the northern part of the longxi loess plateau , has great potential in paleoclimatic studies that means the study reinforced .
the most typical and strongest precipitation processes during meiyu period since 1999 was occurred in zhejiang province in 2011 , and the sharp turned from drought to flood caused by four con- tinuous heavy precipitation processes during meiyu period .
using the objective analysis data , large scale circulation background before and after meiyu periods are analyzed and contrasted at the same period in the history .
at the same time , the different strcture of meiyu front in the four heavy precipitation processes were compared .
the results show that . ( 1 ) before and after the alternation of the middle-high latitude circulation has obvious meridionality . the circulation situation is three-trough and three-ridge before the alternation turning to two-trough and one-ridge after the alternation .
there is only one blocking high in meiyu period . northwesterly ariflow in front of the lake baikal blocking high provides cold air for meiyu .
( 2 ) there is heavy precipitation in front of meiyu front . ascending motion in the meiyu frontal zone coordinates with two branches of sub- sidence , the north one delivers cold air to meiyu front , while the south one and the updraft in meiyu fron- tal zone shapes counter meridional vertical circulation . it also reinforces ascending motion in the meiyu frontal zone .
( 3 ) the meiyu front is always equivalent potential temperature intensive ribbon and nearly upright at low level of troposphere .
since the affect of cold air , there is obvious horizontal temperature gradient in meiyu frontal zone with northward bias of lower level frontal zone during the first , third and fourth rainstorm .
on the contrary , no cold air in the second rainstorm process , there is no temperature gradient in frontal zone and the meiyu front tilts toward south
through the detailed observation of sedex copper , skarntype copper and porphyry copper deposits located in the north , centre and south of namibia , there is one common characteristic of these different types copper deposits , i .
, the copper is en riched in the surface in the form of carbonate mineral ( mainly malachite ) .
as a result of the research , the authors conclude that the arid climate is the main cause of the copper enrichment .
in the arid climate , due to the lack of humus and strong evaporation in the sur- face , the surface is in the state of alkalinity which results in the formation of the calcrete , which spread all over namibia . thus the copper is enriched in the surface and degraded in the oxidation zone .
the upward moving aqueous abnormity presents a high value lo- cally and limited migration .
the genesis of the copper enrichment on the earth &apos; s surface is same as the formation of soil type uranium in namibia
in accordance with the wavelet decomposition and reconstruction technology as well as the training cycles of various fuzz- y neural network models , four runoff forecast models based on the combination of wavelet analysis with fuzzy neural network , i .
mallat algorithm based long cycle runoff forecasting model ; mallat algorithm based short cycle runoff forecasting model ; wavelet packet algorithm based long runoff forecasting model ; wavelet packet algorithm based short cycle runoff forecasting model , are put forward herein , and then the principle , structure and step of the establishment of the models are expatiated as well .
moreover , by taking the monthly runoff data from tangnaihal hydrological station one of the outlet hydrological stations at the source regions of the yellow river as the applied case , the four models mentioned above are comparatively evaluated with the cycle decomposition coefficient and nash-sutcliffe efficiency coefficient .
the result shows that the forecasting effect is best from the mallat algorithm based long cycle runoff forecasting model and that from the wavelet packet algorithm based short cycle runoff forecasting model is worst .
thereby , the main causation of this phenomenon is also analyzed hereirl furthermore , some reasonable suggestions on the application of both the wavelet analysis and the fuzzy neural network to hydrological model are presented as well
a gyro north seeker is a kind of instrument determining geographic azimuth fast and accurately .
its primary characteristics are high orientation accuracy , short orientation time and free orientation on any time and sites except high latitudes .
however , gyro north seeker is easily influenced by abnormal factors that lead to singularities in orientation observations .
adopting rotation-modulation method , an all-attitude north seeker is studied , which employs dynamically tuned gyro as angular velocity sensor .
a mixed iterative algorithm based on robust estimation principle is constructed to degrade influence of abnormal noises on precision of north seeker . it is with high breakdown point initial value and assisted by igg m scheme .
calculations show that the algorithm based on reliable initial value and stable standard deviation factor can effectively degrade abnormal disturbances .
tests indicate that precision of north seeker excels 1.5 ′ in 4 minutes , which is much better than that of applying least squares estimation
by using conventional observation data and ncep reanalysis data , diagnostic analysis is performed on a rainstorm process , which occurred on 22--25 july 2010 in the western part of sichuan basin .
the result shows that the rainstorm was generated under the circulation background that low-level southerly airflows had remained over the region from the south china sea to sichuan basin , so this rainstorm was closely related to the evolution of the southerly wind speeds . the rainfall intensity increased as the south winds grew stronger .
speed convergence formed by the enhanced south winds and positive vorticity advections became main dynamic trigger factors for the rainstorm . therefore , the rainstorm is pretty con- sistent with the low-level convergence and the positive vorticity advection .
in addition , the result of wrf numerical simulation further indicates that : the evolution of 3 h wind speed at 850 hpa has good indication for the development of mesoscale convective systems . on the leeward side of the 3 h wind speed increasing area , convective cloud clusters are to develop rapidly in the next 3 hours .
moreover , the topographic influence simulation tests suggest that the airflow convergence generated in the west of the basin is closely re- lated to the topography of plateau
the following are the main characteristics of the general atmospheric circulation in december 2012 . there is one polar vortex center in the northern hemisphere , and the circulation presents rneridiohal patterns in middle-high latitudes , which is in favor of leading cold air southward .
the south branch trough behaves actively and the subtropical high is stronger than normal years &apos; .
the monthly mean precipitation over china is 17.6 mm , 67.6 % more than the corresponding month of normal years ( 10.5 ram ) .
the monthly mean temperature is --4.4 ℃ , 1.2 ℃ lower than the normal temperature at the same period , of which the mean temperature of beijing breaks the lowest record in history ( -3.2 ℃ ) .
there are five obvious cold air processes and four rainfall processes in the month .
many regions experience extreme cold and extreme day temperature-dropping events , and part of northern china suffers snow disasters . besides , large-scale persisting rainy weather appears jiangnan , south china and other places in southern china
the middle pliocene is an important period in paleoclimate research field , and studying this period can improve our understanding of earth climate system and future climate change .
using the community climate system model version 4.0 with slab ocean model , the individual climate effects of atmospheric co2 concentration , topography and land cover change on climate warming in the middle pliocene relative to the pre-industrial period have been evaluated .
the results show that the global annual mean surface air temperature ( sat ) increases by 2.49k in the middle pliocene relative to the pre-industrial period . the topography change has a weak effect on the global annual mean sat change , with the global annual mean sat increases only by 0.26k , but in the areas where the topography decreases significantly , the warming effect is obvious .
the increase of atmospheric co2 concentration from 280ppm to 405ppm leads to a warming of 1.85k in the global annual mean sat change , and the warming appears at all latitudes . due to the sea ice feedback , the warming in high latitudes is more obvious .
the land cover changes make the global annual mean sat increase by 0.67k , and have the largest warming effect in northern high latitudes , with the largest warming by 6k . in general , the warming effect of atmospheric co2 concentration increase is obvious in the global and zonal annual mean sat change , but in the local area in high latitudes , its influence is not stronger than the effects produced by the topography and land cover changes
the main stream of the juzhang river has been one of the most difficult problems of flood control in yichang . it &apos;s an obvious contradiction in flood controlling . the main flood control measures are strengthe-ning the embankments , reservoir operation , making area for flood detention zones , etc .
intense rainfalls in july 1996 and july 2007 ( 9607 , 0707 ) the juzhang river appeared two large flood processes .
the result indicated . . the peak discharge of the juzhang river was 2 380 m · s-1 and peak water level was 50.15 m in herong hydrometric station in 9607 . after engineering measures of burden the levee distances and reinforcement of levee , it was not accord with hydrological monitoring routine when the peak discharge was only 1950 m3 · s-1 while the peak water level was for 50.07m in 0707 .
through a comparative analysis of multiple factors , the result shows that the flood fluctuation rate , roughness and water surface gradient , reservoir operation are themain reasons caused the abnormality . this conclusion can provide scientific basis for flood forecast and control in the juzhang river
based on the ncep / ncar reanalysis data with the resolution of 1 ° * 1 ° and the observational precipita- tion as well as the 3 h interval trmm precipitation data , a heavy rain process on july 22,2010 in the south of the middle of the yellow river was analyzed using a mesoscale weather research and forecasting model ( wrf ) .
the results indicate that this rainstorm is simulated successfully by the wrf model .
this rainstorm is generated together by a subtropical high over the west pacific and a low trough in the hetao area under a situation of large scale cir- culation .
the abundant water vapor source is from the indian ocean and the southern china sea .
the mesoscale gravity wave is excited by the upper level jet stream on 200 hpa .
according to the divergence field and cloud water distribution , the existence and moving direction of the mesoscale gravity wave could be determined .
the reasons that effect of gravity wave on rainstorm generation in the east area of gansu province are analyzed based on the simulation data . it shows that the mesoscale gravity wave in upper level jet and its absorption in lower atmosphere cause the formation of the rainstorm .
according to the wind direction in upper jet and values distributions of the nonlinear balance equation ( nbe ) , the area and moving direction of the mesoscale gravity wave could be deter- mined in advance , so the falling area and time of rainstorm could be forecasted
the shortcomings of sst gravity field recovery from goce reduce dynamic orbit are pointed out and the main problems of using goce kinematic orbit provided by esa are analyzed . we present the dynamics smoothing method for goce ki- nematic orbit .
the orbit smoothing accuracies ( osas ) using different gravity field model with different degree and order ( d / o ) are compared .
the computational results show that the osa of goco02s is the best one and obviously higher than those of eigen - 5c and itg - grace2010s , and a little better than that of goco01s . the osa using gravity field model with 180 d / o is higher than those with 120 and 150 d / o .
the osa of goco02s with 180 d / o is about 1.8cm , and gains more than 14 % improvement compared to kinematic orbits with 2 . 1cm accuracy .
the velocity accuracy of smoothing orbit can reach o. 05mm / s when gravity field model with at least 150 d / o is used and there is no noticeable accuracy difference between the above - mentioned models for velocity determination

most of the carbonate formation are highly heterogeneous with cavities of different sizes , which makes the prediction of cavity-filled reservoir in carbonate rocks difficult . large cavities in carbonate formations pose serious threat to drilling operations .
logging-while-drilling ( lwd ) is currently used to accurately identify and evaluate cavities in reservoirs during drilling .
in this study , we use the self-adaptive hp-fem algorithm simulate and calculate the lwd resistivity responses of fracture-cavity reservoir cavities .
compared with the traditional h-fem method , the self-adaptive hp-fem algorithm has the characteristics of the self-adaptive mesh refinement and the calculations exponentially converge to highly accurate solutions .
using numerical simulations , we investigated the effect of the cavity size , distance between cavity and borehole , and transmitted frequency on the lwd resistivity response . based on the results , a method for recognizing cavities is proposed .
this research can provide the theoretical basis for the accurate identification and quantitative evaluation of various carbonate reservoirs with cavities encountered in practice

the observation data of the escaped gas from ground water over the past 30 years are processed .
5 times abnormal changes derived from these data respondents to 11 earthquakes within 400 kilometer range with magnitude 5 earthquakes . the respondent rate is 45 % .
the reason is discussed
accurate location of earthquake activity is essentially necessary for study of the detailed structure of faults , however , the standard location methods , such as various versions of geiger ′ s methods , don ′ t work well any longer .
progress in computing technology at present has enabled us to directly face to the non-linear problem of earthquake location , so a new non-linear technique , which may be called time-reversal imaging technique ( trit ) , is proposed for determining earthquake-hypocentroids .
at first , the technique principle is illustrated by means of displacement representation law .
then feasibility is tested for using groups of numerical tests .
accuracy and objectivity of observation arrival time picking are promoted because direct p-wave train is used to build enveloped signal which is further employed to measure the observation arrival times by means of cross-correlation technique .
error caused by linearization of a non-linear problem is eliminated because a non-linear relation between earthquake location and observation arrival times is constructed based on beam-forming technique , which avoids the process of linearization in geiger ′ s methods .
the disadvantage that least-squared solution is sensitive to individual or a few outlier ( s ) in observation data is conquered because the beam-forming technique is employed for solution instead of the least-squared method .
the statistical method used to evaluate uncertainty of the solution based on an assumption that residuals are in normal distribution , which often gives results without practical significance , is abandoned because grid-searching technique is used in finding solution , which provides a solution set , the eigen-radius of which describes resolution , and the resolution and the standard deviations are organized to evaluate the uncertainty .
however , computing efficiency of the trit is rather lower than that of geiger ′ s methods due to the grid-searching process , for example , in this study , about 30s are needed for each process on ordinary desktop computer , but it is a usual solution to change time into accuracy

this paper also presents an overview of gosat data products , calibration and validation strategies .
seismic data reconstruction based on the least-squares fourier method is ultimately transformed into solving a linear equation . the coefficient matrix is toeplitz matrix . the conjugate gradient method can be used to solve the linear equations .
pathological extent of matrix affects iterations of the conjugate gradient method . the more irregular sampled seismic data is , the more pathological the matrix is , then it is more difficult to get convergence and reasonable results .
we study different construction methods of preconditions based on toeplitz matrix and the effects of convergence of the conjugate gradient method .
through the use of preconditions , we can speed up the iterative speed of the conjugate gradient method , improve the convergence of conjugate gradient method and the efficiency of computation .
numerical examples and real seismic data reconstruction experiment show that the preconditioned conjugate gradient method has greatly improved efficiency of calculation
impact of catchment area and mean annual rainfall on simulation accuracy of two hydrological models was estimated by comparative statistical analysis .
two hydrological models , hims and simhyd , were adopted taking as basic data measured at 53 catchments in australia .
it was found that simulation accuracies of hims model and simhyd model were best in those catchments with area of 400-600 km2 and mean annual rainfall of 800-1200 mm .
in catchment areas greater than 600 km2 the catchment heterogeneity would increase , and in catchment areas smaller than 400 km2 the characteristics of nonlinear runoff yield and concentration would become significant .
therefore , simulation accuracies of the two models would become worse in those catchments . simulation accuracies also decreased in catchments with mean annual rainfall greater than 1200 mm or smaller than 800 mm .
because runoff generation theory of excess-infiltration is not applicable with mean annual rainfall greater than 1200 mm , and the local runoff yield and concentration generally exist in those catchments with mean annual rainfall smaller than 800 mm
limited by the storage and moving of the groundwater and the physical condition , we can usually get narrow monitoring results .
so it need to estimate the spatial distribution characters of the groundwater pollutants migration parameters .
this research focused on the function of spatial and temporal variability of groundwater in the environmental assessment , analyzed the anisotropy of the chloride ion migration process , conducted the space-time co-kriging estimation under the conditions of space point removal rate of 33 % and 50 % .
the findings got the conclusions as follows : at other times , the estimation effect of temporal-spatial cokriging ( ck ) keeps balance with the ordinary kriging ( ok ) when there is only temporal information of estimated points but no information of the points to be estimated , and whether points to be estimated are more or less .
so it indicated that the cokriging optimal estimation method that established up on the groundwater environmental assessment of variables stochastic spatial statistical analysis is practical

this paper examines the surface energy imbalance status over the semi-arid areas of the loess plateau , using the data collected by eddy covariance ( ec ) and boundary layer meteorological measurement systems at the semi-arid climate and environment obser- vatory of lanzhou university ( sacol ) .
the energy balance ratio is about 0.80 during the daytime in all seasons , while that is only about 0.20 in the night .
for the observation time with no local circulation , the energy balance ratio is improved to more than 85 % in the daytime . even in the night of spring , summer or autumn , the energy balance ratio is also improved to 70 % . however , the ratio in nighttime of winter is only 29.4 % .
after taking into consideration all the energy budget items , the surface energy is still not closed , which means that the eddy covariance system underestimated the turbulent heat flux . and the observation error changes with seasons , with maximum in winter and minimum in spring .
the errors of sensible heat flux and latent heat flux may impact co 2 flux through the wpl correction , and cause the uncertainty of long term net ecosystem exchange ( nee ) , and the nee throughout the year can be overestimated by 41.2 %

a re-os isotopic study of mesozoic igneous basic to intermediate basic rocks from the western- , eastern-and yishu fault belt tectonic units in shandong province , north china craton ( ncc ) , is carried out .
the samples consists of 13 intrusive rocks from the jinan , yinan plutons and guanshui dykes , and 13 volcanic rocks from the anqiu , mengyin , feixian and fangcheng volcanic successions .
most samples have relatively low re ( 0.076 * 10-9-0.711 * 10-9 ) and os ( 0.006 * 10-9-1.030 * 10-9 ) contents and high radiogenic 187os / 188os ratios , with corresponding initial 187os / 188os ratio of 0.131 6-0.529 1 and γos ( t ) of 4.30-319.00 , except for rock maq0609 of the anqiu trachyandesite with initial 187os / 188os ratio of 1.463 and γos ( t ) of 1 060.000 .
the igneous rocks show a wide range of 0.125 to 2.090 ga in os isotope modal age ( tma ) .
on the γos ( t ) vs. εnd ( t ) and ( 87sr / 86sr ) i vs.
γos ( t ) diagrams , these rocks are positioned between the lithospheric mantle and crust fields , indicative of a crust-mantle interaction-related origin .
all but one guanshui gabbro ( mgs0610 ) and feixian basalts of the samples display no clear positive correlation between γos ( t ) and ( la / ta ) n or ( th / nb ) n , which suggests that the role of crustal assimilation or contamination during the magma ascending was insignificant .
compared with the paleozoic mantle xenoliths , these mantle-derived rocks have evidently younger os modal ages , higher re / os and 187os / 188os ratios .
these crustal signs are likely to have been resulted from interactions of partial melts derived from delaminated lower crust rocks with ambient mantle under an upper mantle depth . besides , on the re / yb vs.
yb diagram , samples of the mengyin andesites and yinan diorites are plotted between the mesozoic pyroxene xenoliths and crust components , which may be best explained by mantle source rocks metasomatized by partial melts of delaminated eclogitic lower crust .
furthermore , a mengyin andesite mmy-12 ( sio2 = 56.4 % ) has a modal age as old as 2.090 ga , and high mg # ( 64.6 ) and os content ( 0.089 * 10-9 ) , which provides an additional evidence for lithospheric thinning-related interaction between the delaminated lower crust and the convecting upper mantle
based on collecting , reorganizing and analyzing of the historical documents about freezing disaster in upper reaches of hanjiang river during historical period , using the methods of least squares , wavelet analysis , mathematical statistics , the rule of time occurrence ( stage , seasonal changes and disasters cycle ) and spatial variation and its social impact of freezing disaster were studied in this study .
the results showed that the freezing disaster happened 118 times in upper reaches of hanjiang river , with averagely once every 24.46 years .
freezing disaster grade could be divided into mild , moderate and severe disaster , and their occurrence probabilities were 16.1 % , 62.71 % and 21.19 % .
wavelet analysis showed that mild freezing disaster happened once 5-8 years moderate freezing disaster did once about 20-23 years , and severe freezing disaster did once 60-55 years .
freezing disaster in the upper reaches of hanjiang river showed the volatility rising trend since historical period , phase characteristics , experienced a frequency less-increased volatility-a rapid increase in three stages ;
spring freezing disaster occured most frequently , and mainly the frost disaster .
freezing disaster had a major impact on the prevailing socio-economic development , agricultural production , social stability , population changes , etc .
therefore , primary conclusions can be made that there were two cold climatic events in upper reaches of hanjiang river during historical period , which occurred during 1640-1700 and 1840-1870 respectively
during the design of submarine pipelines , it is a crucial problem to determine the interaction between the pipeline and the subsoil .
the uplift , lateral and axial soil resistances acting on the pipelines are investigated considering the moving directions of the pipelines in the thermal overall buckling analysis .
soft clay is chosen as the supporting medium in view of geotechnical conditions in bohai gulf .
a series of model tests are carried out to facilitate the establishment of substantial data base for a variety of burial pipeline topologies . in the tests , the pipes with different diameters are buried with different depth-to-diameter ratios . the uplift , lateral and axial resistances are recorded during the tests .
based on the test data , a numerical method is established and used to analyze an actual dimensional pipeline in practice .
the test results show that the uplift and lateral soil resistances depend on the pipe diameters and cover depth more greatly than the axial soil resistance .
according to the test data and numerical results , the experimental formulae are proposed to determine the maximum soil resistance and the corresponding displacement of pipelines for all their three moving directions
the pacific decadal oscillation ( pdo ) recently emerged in the literature as a robust signal in the northern hemisphere climate variability . many studies reported that the relationships between pdo and east asian monsoon ( eam ) and climate variability in china are significant . however , the possible mechanisms are still unclear .
using the observational ncep / ncar reanalysis and chinese station data during the period of 1969 - 2008 , the present study investigates the interdecadal relationship between pacific decadal oscillation ( pdo ) and interhemispheric air mass imbalance or oscillation ( iho ) between the northern and southern hemispheres .
the possible connection of pdo and iho with both east asian monsoon and climate variability in china are also assessed in this study . it is found that the interdecadal components ( 11 ~ 38years ) of pdo , iho , and eam contribute large variance to low frequency variations , and they are well-matched with each other on ( inter ) decadal timescale .
in particular , their negative phases mainly appeared in the 1970sand late 1990s , while positive phase in period from 1980sto mid 1990s . decadal change of global mean air columnar temperature may be the key factor for the notable difference between pdo and iho from mid 1970sto mid 1990s .
this contributes to hemispherical and land-sea mass exchange and redistribution , and also leads to the decadal displacement of both upward and downward branch of walker circulation .
in positive phase of pdo , an anomalous anticyclone is found in the mongolian region in both boreal summer and winter seasons , inducing significant anomalous northerlies in eastern china , and hence intensifying ( weakening ) the east asian winter ( summer ) monsoon .
consequently , the interdecadal components of temperature and precipitation at most stations in east china are simultaneously correlated with the pacific decadal oscillation index significantly

currently , gnss-leo ionospheric radio occultation ( iro ) is a new and powerful technique in probing ionosphere .
in order to eliminate the effect from the topside ionosphere above leo , the calibrated tec inversion technique retrieves electron density profiles utilizing non-occultation side measurements .
in this paper , a new technique is firstly proposed based on the epoch difference , and then the two techniques are applied in the inversion of simulated data , subsequently some conclusions can be drawn from the inversion results and its error analysis : the inversion results derived from the epoch difference inversion technique show better performance than those derived from the calibrated tec inversion technique ;
no matter which inversion technique is used , the inversion results at the higher orbits ( ~ 800 km ) are better than those at the lower orbits ( ~ 500 km ) .
the lower the profile altitudes , the lower the precision of inversion ;
the inversion errors are significant during 8-18 ( local time ) , and are mainly located between-30 ° and 30 ° ( magnetic latitude )

flood disaster and soil erosion are the most important environmental concerns in the han river basin . both problems are closely related to rainfall , especially erosive rainfall ( ≥ 12 mm / d ) .
erosive rainfall is the driving force of severe soil erosion and is the direct cause of flood disaster .
thus the study of erosive rainfall patterns in the han river basin has important practical significance .
daily rainfall data during the period of 1951-2012 were used to investigate the spatio-temporal variations in annual rainfall , annual erosive rainfall and annual rainstorm in the han river basin . the data were from 47 meteorological stations in or near the study area .
conventional statistical methods were used to analysis relationships between the three rainfall indices ( annual rainfall , annual erosive rainfall and annual rainstorm ) . the mean annual value , anomaly percentage of every year , and variation coefficient of the three rainfall indices were calculated .
spatial distribution of the three rainfall indices about the 47 meteorological stations were derived by the kriging weighting interpolation method in a gis platform with the help of geographic information system ( gis ) technology .
the results showed that the mean annual precipitation is 886 mm , mean annual erosive rainfall ( ≥ 12 mm ) is 614.1 mm , and mean annual storm rainfall ( ≥ 50 mm ) is 167.6 mm in the han river basin during the study period .
the annual rainfall , erosive rainfall and rainstorm decreased over the past six decades , but the tendency is not significant . there is no significant wet-dry trend displayed .
the fluctuation range of the annual rainstorm amount is more than that of the annual rainfall amount .
all the three rainfall indices decreased gradually from southeast direction to northwest direction .
the results can improve the understanding of the rainfall variation law in the han river basin .

using numerical simulation method , the variations of distribution and peak value of near-fault pgv with different fault depth were studied in detail , and the reason of some phenomena were discussed .
the simulation results show that the distribution characters of pgv fault-parallel ( fp ) component and fault-normal ( fn ) component are distinctly different , the value of pgv fn component is much larger than that of fp component .
with the increase of fault depth , the distribution region of fn component strong pgv moves forward along the rupture direction , while the strong pgv zone of fp component becomes gradually far away from the fault trace along the direction perpendicular to the strike .
however , no matter fn component or fp component , the strong pgv distribution area and its value are both quickly reduced with increased fault depth .
the results above suggest that the fault depth have significant effect on both fn component and fp component of near-fault peak ground velocity

exploitation suitability assessment is a basic work and precondition of reasonable development and utilization for uninhabited island . however , recent studies and practices of exploitation suitability assessment mostly focus on the land and coastal zone , and the comprehensive assessments of exploitation suitability based on the characteristic of uninhabited island are rarely reported . the exploitation suitability of uninhabited island depends on a comprehensive assessment of the importance of island ecosystem and exploitation feasibility .
therefore , an assessment index system of exploitation suitability for uninhabited island includes species , habitats and natural , history or cultural heritage in view of the ecosystem importance and environment , resources and socio-economic conditions , and the exploitation feasibility that established firstly in this paper .
then experts consultation method and analysis hierarchy process ( ahp ) method are used to analyze the index weight . after quantification and standardization the indices , mutually exclusive matrix for assessing the exploitation suitability is set up .
lastly , the index system and the methods are applied to 18 uninhabited islands in xiamen sea area for exploitation suitability assessment . the results showed that , on the whole , the exploitation suitability of xiamen &apos;s uninhabited islands is low . there are no island classified as high exploitation suitability , and only 7 islands are at middle level , 8 at low and the others as unsuitable for exploitation .
the results are consistent with the development decisions of uninhabited islands made by state oceanic administration people &apos;s republic of china . different development advices are given to islands with different exploitation suitability .
for islands with middle exploitation suitability , the suggestion is moderate development based on its resources .
for islands of low exploitation suitability , ecosystem protection and nature conservation of the island are the most important .
for those unsuitable for exploitation , the key work must be reinforcing ecosystem protection , and reconstructing and repairing habitats when necessary .

previous exploration and research results show that the carbonate reservoir spaces of the ordovician yingshan formation in ka-1 3d acreage in tazhong area are dominated by fractures and dissolution pores .
however , recent reprocessed seismic data reveal some bead-shaped and short-axis-shaped high amplitude anomalies in ka-1 3d seismic data .

the base-level change and the inter-architectures of meandering river sands , especially the relationship among the base-level change and the development degrees of intercalations and the intercalations occurrence were researched by using the high-resolution sequence stratigraphy and the reservoir architecture element analysis .
the conclusions are as follows : the nmⅱ &amp; nmⅲ oil groups develop three complete mid-term base-level cycles , two incomplete mid-term base-level cycles , twelve short-term base-level cycles and nineteen ultra-short term base-level cycles .
the types of the base-level cycles can be divided into upward-deepening and upward-shallowing asymmetry , incomplete symmetry dominated by uprising , and nearly complete symmetry .
when the base-level is low , the channels are wide and cut each other seriously , the point bars are developed , and the inclinations and the drilling frequencies of later-accretion layers are small .
when the base-level is high , the single channel is narrow and deep , so the channel sands bindingly insert into the mudstones , the development degrees of point bars are poor , but the embankments are developed , and the inclinations and the drilling frequencies of later-accretion layer are high
through analyzing the monitoring data of the landslide , it indicates that the monitoring point s accumulation displacement amounts depended on the monitoring periods , which reflects the characteristics of fractal .
at the same time , based on the landslide fissures development process , the motion directions of the landslide internal points are getting uniform , and the motion fractal dimension number reduced .
taking a landslide in three-gorge area for example , this landslide is creeping with a constant velocity according to the analysis of the macroscopic deformations .
meanwhile , the fractal dimension numbers of the gps monitoring points motion trajectory curves are calculated by the box-counting law from 2007 to 2009 year , and the results are all close to 1 . the results indicate that the motion directions of the monitoring points become uniform ; and the dominant controlling factor plays an important role in the landslide deformation ; it is consistent with the reality deformation features .
therefore , the fractal theory applying to the monitoring point s motion trajectory analysis is an effective way to use the monitoring data to judge and predict the landslide development stage

the boundary layer is very important to human activity as the transition zone between the surface and free atmosphere .
turbulence structure of the boundary layer especially the entrainment layer is an important aspect for the boundary layer research , which is very important to improve understanding of the boundary layer and the research of the boundary layer parameterization .
because of the high level of the top of the boundary layer , it is difficult to detect extensively .
generation and evolution of the atmospheric convective layer are simulated in laboratory convective water tank with the dimension of 150 cm * 150 cm * 60 cm .
when the collimated light beam propagates through the simulated atmospheric convective boundary layer , facula image data can be obtained .
using improved covariance method for power spectrum analysis on the facula image , the peak frequency can be found by finding the maximum power spectral density corresponding to the frequency , which is needed to obtain the peak wavelength as the characteristic scale of eddy .
it is found that , in the mixed layer , peak wavelength is small , which means that the mixed layer is homogeneously mixed and small scale dominated there .
but in entrainment layer the peak wavelength is larger .
the average peak wavelength in the entrainment zone has some relation with the convective richardson number , and the relation is influenced by surface types and convection condition

the microsparite calcite crystals in the molar tooth structure are not wholly arranged in the dense form , and there are some gypsums infilling the intercrystal pores . it can be seen from the result of empa that it contains ca , si , al and ti , which precipitated from the intercrystal pore at the late diagenetic stage .
the algal stromatolite can exist with molar tooth structures , suggesting that the formation of molar tooth structure had some relationship with algal ; the assemblage of microsparite can serve as the cement of algae aggregates and oolite , exhibiting biochemical acting and hydrodynamic sorting in high energy water , which couldn &apos;t be caused directly by the algae .
this paper has also interpreted the reason why the molartooth structures with wide middle part and tip end point appeared . the branched secondary molar tooth structures were induced by the reduction of stress which was affected by the heterogeneity and anisotropy of the rocks .
it is shown from the genetic analysis that the formation processes of molar-tooth structure were as follows : the partly high pressure environment in the rock was caused by the decomposition of organic matter in the substrate induced by the bacteria .
when the pressure exceeded the breakdown pressure , the rock failed and all kinds of cracks came into being . after that , the liquid filled up the cracks and crystallized quickly , causing the transference of high pressure to other places , resulting in the continuation of the same process and the appearance of condensed molar-tooth structures until the equilibrium of the pressure in the rock
a new absorbing boundary method for diffusive-viscous wave equation ( dvw ) is proposed to deal with the artificial reflections from boundaries caused by a truncated computational domain in seismic wave numerical modeling .
the main idea is to make the seismic waves exponentially attenuate with propagation distance by adding a proper absorbing layer around the boundary of computational domain .
the solution of the wave equation in infinite homogenous space is obtained by using fourier transform .
then , auxiliary equations are constructed by introducing decay functions such that the solution of auxiliary equations is the solution of the dvw equation in computational domain and decays exponentially at boundaries .
the wave equation is finally solved by using finite-difference method in both homogeneous media and homogeneous layered media .
numerical results are given through comparison of the results from the proposed method and those of non-absorbing boundary condition , and show that boundary reflections are absorbed with the proposed method .
the proposed method is also applicable to acoustic equation and stokes equation

in-situ la-icp-ms zircon u-pb dating of dacite from the chenpeng formation volcanic suite in shuangqiao area , luoshan county , henan province , demonstrates that the mesozoic volcanic rocks from the western segment of northern dabie mountain were formed at ca .
133 ± 1.5 ma , being coeval with the main volcanism in the eastern segment of the dabie mountain , which is represented by the early cretaceous maotanchang formation volcanic rocks .
the mesozoic volcanism in western north dabie is also coeval with , or slightly earlier than the large-scale intrusion of granodioritic plutons in the dabie mountain and the large-scale volcanism in the lu-zong and ning-wu volcanic basins along the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river .
thus , the results obtained by the authors suggest that the volcanic rocks in western north dabie probably represent one of the large scale mesozoic magmatic activities in eastern china , which has commonly been thought as results of strong lithosphere thinning and delamination caused by continental gravity instability , which was likely induced by the oblique subduction of pacific plate .
in contrast with the volcanics in the ning-wu and lu-zong basins and eastern dabie mountain , the western north dabie volcanic rocks are characterized by somewhat higher ( 87sr / 86sr ) i ( 0.707 56 ) and remarkably lower εnd ( t ) ( -20.1 ) , and more enriched lile and depleted nb and ta .
these geochemical features suggest that western dabie volcanic rocks have experienced lower degree of metasomatism of mantle-derived materials than volcanic rocks in eastern china , which further suggests a westward decrease in the mesozoic lithosphere stretching and asthenosphere upwelling
there are three petrogenetically different pyroxenites , namely cumulate pyroxenite , metamorphosed oceanic crust , and metasomatic pyroxenite .
type i pyroxenites formed as crystallization segregates from mantle-derived melts under pressure of 1.5 ~ 2.5 gpa .
they commonly show cumulated or igneous textures and do not form perfect linear correlations in a cao / mgo-sio 2 / mgo plot .
type i pyroxenits show no eu anomaly and their sr-nd-o isotopes are similar to those of mantle rocks .
type ii pyroxenites are metamorphic products of recycled oceanic crust .
they commonly show a deformed texture , forming a linear correlation in a cao / mgo-sio 2 / mgo plot and show a positive eu anomaly . while theirε nd values are identical to those of the morb , their sr-o isotopes show distinct features .
metasomatic pyroxenites result from interactions between melts and peridotite .
to explain the co-existence of pyroxenites of different origins within a single ultramafic massif , the following model is conceived : the oceanic upper crust , including basalts and sediments , produces considerable elementally variable fluids and magmas , which react with surrounding peridotites and convert it to pyroxenites and also form type i pyroxenites by high-pressure crystal segregation along magma conduits in the peridotites .
the oceanic lower crust consisting of troctolite and gabbroic rocks retained their original compositions and translated to type ⅱ pyroxenites without partial melting or other significant metasomatic reaction during subduction and exhumation at subsolidus conditions

based on daily meteorological data from two stations and themountainous runoff of six rivers from 1956 to 2009 , the stream flow characteristics and hydroligical responses to climatic change in the upper reaches of shiyang river basin were analyzed by using fao penman-monteith model , wavelet transform and accumulative anomaly .
the results show that , firstly , there was a weak decreasing trend for the mountainous runoff in the tianzhu region , with the runoff trend rate being -0.288 * l0 ~ 8 m ~ 3 / 10a , among which the reducing rate of the huangyang river was the most abovious , with the streamflow trend rate being -0.069 * l0 ~ 8 m ~ 3 / 10a .
comparatively speaking , there were plentiful water periods in the 1950s , 1960s and 1980s and low water periods in the 1970s and 1990s .
the runoff slightly increased in 2000s , especially for the period of 2002-2009 .
secondly , precipitation showed a little inecrease with the tendency rate of 1.165 mm / 10 a from 1956 to 2009 .
the increasing trend of temperature was obvious , especially for the period of 1990s-2000s , with the inclination rate being 0.298 ℃ / 10 a .
meanwhile , the increasing trend of potential evapotranspiration , with the tendency rate of 2.206 mm / 10 a , was relatively obvious during the period of 1956-2009 . thirdly , there were a significantly positive correlation between pricipitation and mountainous runoff , whose fluctuation processes appeared to be perfactly synchronic . and negative correlations were all significant both between runoff and temperature and between runoff and potential evapotranspiration .
at the same time , there were significant periods at scale of 3 a , 7-8 a and 22 a for runoff , temperature and potential evapotranspiration . furthermore , the first main periods were all quasi 22 a . therefore , responses of the runoff variation to regional climate anomalies were impressionable , but the responses of runoff variation to each climate element were different and annual variation of runoff depended on the comprehensive effect of climate elements

a severe occlusion type of squall line is investigated by using observational data analysis and wrf model simulation , which occurred in henan province in china on june 3 , 2009 and produced surface damaging high wind .
the observational data analysis result shows that : the right branch of this system has some similar features to typical squall lines .
some features such as thunderstorm high , boundary outflow , cold pool , and wake depression are presented in the mature stage .
by contrast , for the right branch there are not significant features such as stratiform cloud , thunderstorm high , and cold pool in the left branch of the squall line . the surface wind within the region of left branch is weaker than that in the right branch .
high wind was mainly caused by the right branch of the system .
high-resolution model outputs reveal that the formation of occlusion morphology of this system is caused by cold wind shear and warm wind shear near the ground . these shears lead to the existence of right branch with stratiform cloud and left branch without stratiform cloud , respectively .
furthermore , the formation mechanism of the surface high wind and the organization mode of the right branch of this system in the mature stage have been revealed : the downward motion of the convective region in the right branch is intense in developing and mature stage . rear inflow in the middle troposphere may intensify such downward motion .
rear inflow is an important factor for surface high wind .
there are three major air flows within the cross section of the right branch , including front-to-rear inflow in front of the squall line , rear-to-front inflow in the middle layer , and inflow in the lower layer which changes to outflow in the high layer
using the national snow and ice data center ( nsidc ) snow cover and snow water equivalent data , monthly four-layer soil temperature from era40 reanalysis dataset , the mechanisms of the linkage between the winter northern eurasian fresh snow extent ( winter tfse ) and subsequent summer climate anomalies in china are investigated .
correlation analysis shows that , the consistent seasonal evolvements of land anomalies act as a bridge for the lag correlation . a large winter tfse is followed by a slower northeastward retreating progress of snow and frozen soil over northern eurasia .
consequently , in summer , snow and frozen soil over east asian middle and high latitudes melt more intensively , the soil temperature correspondingly gets lower than normal , which influences local temperature by cooling and by influencing local meridional wind , and through enhancing east asian jet , is related to the subtropical high in the western pacific , even climate anomalies in china , and vice versa .
as well as local variations of land factors over east asian middle and high latitudes are concerned , the signal of winter tfse is significantly strengthened during snow-and-frozen-soil melting process
a daily gridded precipitation dataset ( aphro ) for asia was created by the asian precipitation-highly resolved observational data integration towards the evaluation of water resources ( aphrodite ) project in japan . the resolution of this dataset is 0.25 ° * 0.25 ° , and the length is from 1951 to 2007 .
this study aims to assess the quality of the aphro rainfall in contiguous china from the perspective of climatological mean , rainfall classes , and long-term trend . daily rainfall records observed by 559 rain gauges are used for the comparison .
the results are as follows : ( 1 ) for the mean states , the aphro shows similar distribution of precipitation amount to station data , and can accurately characterize the seasonal migration of rain-belt .
however , compared with station data , this dataset underestimates precipitation intensity , but overestimates precipitation frequency .
( 2 ) for the distribution of different classes of precipitation , annual mean precipitation amount for heavy rainfall derived from the aphro data is lower , while the amounts for light and moderate rainfall are higher than the station data .
the aphro data exhibit a similar trend in the southeastern coastal region and northwestern china , but a different pattern in northern china , northeastern china , and jianghuai region .
in addition , analysis on the seasonality of interdecadal variability indicates that the characteristics of &quot; southern china food and northern china drought &quot; and &quot; jiangnan late spring drought &quot; derived from the aphro data are different from those derived from station data .
this study investigated the snow albedo and hydrological effects on the precipitation in south china in 2010 , based on the singular value decomposition ( svd ) analysis of the eurasian snow depth dataset and the 160-station rainfall dataset in china .
three ensemble simulations were conducted by using community atmosphere model 3.1 ( cam3.1 ) . the first ensemble simulation includes both the snow albedo and the snow hydrological effect .
the second ensemble simulation only considers the snow albedo effect but ignores the hydrological effect .
the third ensemble simulation only considers the snow hydrological effect but ignores the albedo effect .
the results indicate that both these effects could have impacts on the south china rainfall .
however , there are great differences in amplitudes and ranges of abnormities induced by those three simulations . the magnitude of abnormities caused by the snow hydrological effect is larger than that by the albedo effect .
when those two effects work together , the result agrees well with observations and the magnitude is the largest .
however , the magnitude is not equal to the sum of that caused by the snow albedo and hydrological effects respectively
the features of diurnal variation of sea surface temperature ( sst ) are simulated in the lasg / iap climate system ocean model ( licom ) by resolving the diurnal variation of solar radiation and the influence of weak mixing is investigated .
forced by the ideal diurnal variation of solar radiation , some features of diurnal variation of sst can be captured in licom with 10-m vertical resolution in the upper layers . the diurnal variation of solar radiation also results in diurnal variation of currents in the upper layers .
the horizontal distribution of diurnal amplitude of simulated sst is consistent with that of observed sst and modulated by the diurnal amplitude of solar radiation .
in the eastern pacific cold tongue , the diurnal amplitude of simulated sst is about 0.3 ℃ -0.4 ℃ and 0.1 ℃ -0.2 ℃ , smaller than that of observations .
the peak of daily sst variation appears during 1500-1600 lst and lags 2-3 hours than the peak time of daily solar radiation , which is close to observation .
after reducing mixing , the diurnal amplitude of sst variation increases in the equatorial eastern pacific cold tongue , closer to observation .
this indicates that the features of diurnal variation in the equatorial eastern pacific cold tongue are mainly controlled by the diurnal variation of solar radiation and vertical mixing .
after reducing mixing , under the modulation of solar radiation , the mean states including the mixed layer depth , temperatures and currents are obviously changed .
in the northern part of the eastern pacific cold tongue , the reduced mixing causes heat accumulation in the upper layers and then leads to an increase in sst about 0.3 ℃ .
while in the southern part , the enhanced meridional advection leads to a decrease in sst about 0.2 ℃
wavelet analysis reveals that the significant periods of eurasian teleconnection pattern index ( eu index ) are 2-4 years .
the result suggests that the interannual variation of the eu is dominant , whereas the interdecadal component is weak .
in a winter with positive eu phase , the east asian westerly jet stream at 200 hpa tends to be enhanced and the east asian trough at 500 hpa becomes stronger . in the meantime , there are the surface northerly anomalies in east asia which lead to a cooling condition over there . the opposite situations tend to occur in a negative eu winter .
hence , during the boreal winter the cooling and less precipitation are likely to occur in most of eastern china associated with a positive phase of eu
it shows that there are two dominant modes , the first eof mode depicting a precipitation oscillation between the yangtze river valley and south china , and the second eof mode describing a consistent precipitation anomaly over the south of the yangtze river .
the result of the comparison between these two time scales shows that the pattern for the precipitation oscillation between the yangtze river valley and south china has clear interannual and interdecadal variations , and the pattern for the consistent precipitation anomaly over the south of the yangtze river is mainly characterized by interdecadal variation .
the atmospheric circulation and the sea surface temperature ( sst ) patterns associated with these two modes are investigated through the regression / correlation method . it shows that although the leading modes of interannual component are similar to those at the decadal scale , the associated circulation and sst anomalies are quite different .
the atmospheric circulation anomalies associated with the pattern which shows the precipitation oscillation between the yangtze river valley and south china for the interannual component include the double blockings at mid-high latitudes and the meridional wave train over eurasia , and the east asian subtropical jet shows significant positive anomaly .
the atmospheric circulation anomalies associated with this pattern of the interdecadal component include the consistent positive geopotential height anomaly over eurasia , and the subtropical high over east asia strengthens and shifts northward .
the sst anomalies associated with this pattern of the interannual component is mainly represented by the positive sst anomaly over the ocean around japan and the indian ocean during the preceding winter and spring , and over the south china sea during the simultaneous meiyu period .
the sst anomalies associated with this pattern of the interdecadal component is mainly represented by the negative horseshoe sst anomaly over the north pacific during the simultaneous meiyu period .
the atmospheric circulation anomalies associated with the pattern which shows the consistent precipitation anomaly over the south of the yangtze river for the interannual component are characterized by the okhotsk blocking high and the meridional wave train in east asia .
and the atmospheric circulation anomalies associated with this pattern of the interdecadal component include the positive geopotential height anomaly over eurasia and the east asian subtropical jet weakens and shifts southward .
the sst anomalies associated with this pattern of the interannual component mainly are represented by the negative sst anomaly over the north pacific and the positive sst anomaly over the east coast of australia during the preceding winter and spring , and the positive sst anomaly over the south china sea during the simultaneous meiyu season .
the positive sst anomalies over the coast seas of east asia during the preceding winter and spring , and those over the south china sea and the tropical western pacific during the simultaneous meiyu period are highly correlated with this pattern of the interdecadal component
using a nonlinear quasi-geostrophic barotropic model , the paper investigates numerically how the spatial pattern of synoptic scale waves and the westerly wind strength affect the phase transition of the north atlantic oscillation ( nao ) , and the role played by the large-scale topography .
it is found that the weak basic westerly wind is favorable for the westward shift of the downstream large-scale system , favoring the transition of the nao from positive ( negative ) phase into negative ( positive ) phase .
it is noted that when the synoptic scale waves are stronger and concentrated in a wider region , the nao event can transform more easily from the negative phase into positive phase ;
when the synoptic scale waves are stronger and shift northward , the nao can transform more easily from the positive into negative phase .
in the presence of a large scale topography , the number of the cases in which the nao transforms from positive ( negative ) phase to negative ( positive ) phase is reduced
a time-scale decomposition ( tsd ) approach was introduced to statistically downscale the predictand which contains distinct variablity linked with distinct large-scale predictors .
it decomposed both the predictand and the predictors into distinct components through filtering and calibrated distinct predictive equations , respectively .
due to the interannual and inter-decadal variability in july-august north china rainfall , it was used as a case to be downscaled by tsd approach .
sea level pressure , 500-hpa geopotential height , 850-hpa meridional wind , and sea surface temperature were considered as predictor parameters ; several well-known large-scale climate indices were also taken as potential predictors .
an approach of cross-validation-based stepwise regression was used to formulate the regression equations .
the downscaling model for the interannual rainfall variability was linked to the sea surface temperature over the mid-eastern tropical pacific in june and the 850-hpa meridional wind over east china in july-august , while that for the inter-decadal rainfall variability was related to the sea level pressure over the southwestern indian ocean in june under the effect of sea surface temperature over the indian ocean-pacific warm pool .
the downscaled interannual and inter-decadal rainfall components were added together to obtain the downscaled total rainfall .
the results in the independent validation period ( 1991-2008 ) showed that the tsd approach performed well to downscale july-august north china rainfall with the correlation coefficient of 0.82 and relative root-mean-square error of 14.8 % .
with the hindcasted predictors by general circulation models ( gcms ) , the downscaling model was used to hindcast july-august north china rainfall over 1991-2001 .
compared to gcm-hindcasted rainfall , the downscaling model showed better performance , which improved the original bias in terms of insufficient interannual variation in gcm hindcast .
the correlation coefficient between the observed and downscaled rainfall reached 0.45 , much higher than 0.12 in gcm hindcast
the global warming and climate change has changed the pattern of precipitation and the extreme weather has been frequently witnessed .
fogang county has been selected as the pilot site and the statistics of the daily precipitation data during 1960-2009 has shown the rainfall has reduced in recent 50 years . this changing trend has been more obvious in may and october . the maximum daily rainfall has shown the same reducing trend , indicating that the reduction of the storm rain may be the main reason of the abatements .
it may imply that the climate change will lower the occurrence frequency of flood disasters in fogang county
the control experiment and two assimilation experiments of wrf regional mesoscale model prediction are verified for typhoon haitang ( 0505 ) .
based on the wrf-3dvar system , the fy-2c infrared and water vapor cloud motion winds are assimilated into wrf model .
the assimilation data of one assimilation test are the cloud motion winds before quality control and those of the other are cloud motion winds after quality control .
the effect of the cloud motion winds on the prediction of rain and wind field is analyzed through comparing the three tests .
results show that the assimilation of the quality-controled cloud motion winds into the initial fields has positive impact on prediction of the area and intensity of rain , and also indicate that different grades of ts score are improved by far than the other tests .
the assimilation makes improvement in the forecast of wind .
the same approach as that for haitang is taken to simulate other two typhoon cases and the ts scores of the forecast rainfall are given . and the results for the two typhoon cases show similar conclusions .
therefore , assimilating cloud motion winds with reasonable control and selection can well improve the descriptive possibility of wind field in wrf model , supply the mesoscale information in the initialization field to improve the simulation result of precipitation and wind field and have positive impact on the forecasting ability of wrf model finally

in order to discuss the application problem of unit quaternion in photogrammetry , research was carried out in this paper systemically into rigorous solution of collinearity equations by using unit quarternion based rotation matrices .
starting from the basic theories and its operations of unit quaternion , rigorous linearized expression of unit quaternion based collinearity equations are derived in detail and there is no need to derive the rotation matrix .
tests by using both simulated data and real image data indicate that linearized collinearity equations have many merits such as having a very simple form , being independent of initial values , and having a high convergent speed compared to two other rotation matrices orthe euler angle based rotation matrix .
so , unit quaternion based rotation matrix should be used widely in practical application

timing and climate change with a 2 ℃ global warming , with reference to the pre-industrial period , have been paid more attention to worldwide .
in particular , many countries , including the member states of the european union , and international organizations have set the greenhouse-gas emission targets for limiting global warming to 2 ℃ .
, the model outputs from the 20th century climate in coupled models ( 20c3m ) and from the special report on emission scenarios ( sres ) emission scenarios b1 , a1b , and a2 , are used to analyze the timing , atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases , and climate change over china with a 2 ℃ global warming .
based on the multi-model ensemble mean , a 2 ℃ global warming is expected to occur in 2064 , 2046 , and 2049 , with equivalent atmospheric co2 concentrations of 625 ppm , 645 ppm , and 669 ppm , under the sres b1 , a1b , and a2 , respectively .
at that time , warming is stronger overall in china .
where the spatial pattern is concerned , warming is stronger towards the north and on the qinghai-tibetan plateau .
at the national scale , annual mean surface air temperature is elevated by 2.7-2.9 ° c , and the winter temperature is elevated by 3.1-3.2 ℃ , which is the strongest among the seasons .
annual mean precipitation is reduced by 0-5 % in most parts of south china , but increased by 0-20 % in the rest of the country . annual ( seasonal ) mean precipitation is increased on average by 3.4 % -4.4 % ( 0.5 % -6.6 % ) over china
based on the dual-doppler radar data of the mobile weather radar ( cinrad / ccj ) and changle weather radar ( cinrad / sa ) , the characteristics of three-dimensional wind structure in the puissant and weakening phases of the strong banded echo of super typhoon sepat ( 0709 ) on 18 august 2007 are examined by means of dual-doppler radar retrieval in the earth coordinate .
the results reveal that : 1 ) during the puissant phase , there were strong east by north wind centers ( strong wind core ) along the right or the back of the right side of strong echoes in their course , even weak wind center existed in the front of the strongest echo .
the structure maintained from the lower layer to the mid-layer , thus the strong echoes corresponded to the horizontal convergence and positive vorticity , resulting in significantly upward movement which helped the development and maintenance of convection .
and the clouds migrated quickly .
relative to the moving clouds , the anterior and posterior air in the mid-lower layer flowed to the strong echoes , and then converged and ascended with maximum vertical velocity between strong echo center and the wind core on its northern side .
in the meanwhile , divergence appeared in the higher layer over the strong echo area , and the air mainly flowed out backward .
2 ) during the weakening period , the weak wind center was located at the strong echo center or its north side with negative vorticity .
the clouds moved slowly and the easterlies went through the clouds .
the convergence over the echo area weakened and the obvious updraft appeared in the mid-layer strong echo near the typhoon center . thus the banded echo has been difficult to maintain .
3 ) strong wind core could transport the momentum and water vapor of weakening spiral cloud bands on the posterior side to the developing area of the banded echo ;
therefore the strong wind core structure was likely to be the main cause for the rapid development of banded echo
according to dynamic geomorphologic investigation of near shore area in dalian taiping bay , geomorphic morphological characteristics such as erosion and accumulation , erosion morphology of seashore , distribution of the sediment on the seabed around the plant site were studied in this paper .
the analysis results demonstrate that the erosion in the studied zone is obvious geomorphic features .
there are eroded pillars , cliffs and platforms . the bay ′ s beach is at a tiny silting state and its width is large . in the sediment , the proportion of the coarse medium sand is especially high , and the sediment is coarser in the north and finer in the south in the plane distribution .
the sea-closure engineering is being constructed in a large area near taiping bay , and the stone dike of sea cucumber farming advances towards the sea . its scale and area are quite large , and seashore is changing in significant range
secondly , the authors selected several important factors by correlation analysis , and discussed the relationship between these factors and east asian summer monsoon ( easm ) . in addition , the potential forecast capability of these factors for the summer rainfall in the mlyr was discussed by historical hindcasts .
the results suggest that the important winter predictors for the summer rainfall in the mlyr mainly come from the external forcing , such as the sst in nio3 and kuroshio current regions , and the snow depth in tibetan plateau .
in contrast , the potential spring predictors are almost the general circulation indices , such as arctic oscillation ( ao ) , polar vortex , and the western north pacific subtropical high ( wnpsh ) .
running correlations between these potential predictors and the summer rainfall in the mlyr vary on interdecadal time scale , however , the sst in kuroshio current region , the snow depth in the tibetan plateau , and the surface air temperature near lake baikal show the significant antecedents for summer rainfall in the mlyr by affecting the easm circulations , and jointly suggest the better forecast capability for the rainfall anomaly in the mlyr after 1979
the results indicate that the spatial distributions and temporal evolutions of pacific-north american ( pna ) , eurasia-pacific ( eup ) , west pacific ( wp ) , and west atlantic ( wa ) teleconnection patterns change significantly at the end of the 1970s .
the spatial distribution changes are found in the intensity and range of abnormal centers of these teleconnection patterns .
on temporal evolution , the upward tendency of pna and wp indexes and the downward tendency of eup and wa indexes are also found .
after the end of the 1970s , the key sst areas impacting on the 5 teleconnection patterns during the northern hemisphere winter have changed , in which those areas impacting on the eup , and those areas in the pacific impacting on wa have significantly decreased ;
those areas in the middle and southern atlantic impacting on ea have obviously changed .
on the time scale above 16 years , the variation of pdo is the main reason which leads to the variation of pna , eup , wp , and wa teleconnection patterns ;
the variation of atm is the main reason which leads to the variation of wa and ea teleconnection patterns during the northern hemisphere winter
this paper assesses the performance of a new climate system model , namely cas-esm-c ( chinese academy of sciences-earth system model-climate system component ) , which employs the recently improved version of iap agcm , namely iap agcm4 , as its atmospheric component .
this paper first describes the development and framework of the model briefly , and then evaluates the performances of the model in simulating the climate mean states of the atmosphere , land surface , ocean , and sea ice . some aspects of the seasonal cycle and interannual variability are also analyzed .
the results indicate that the cas-esm-c succeeds in controlling the long-term climate drift and has acceptable performances in realistically reproducing the climate mean states of the atmosphere , ocean , land surface and sea ice .
the cas-esm-c also successfully reproduces the seasonal cycle of sst over the tropical pacific and the seasonal cycle of the sea ice cover in the arctic .
the seasonal migration of monsoon rain band is well reproduced in the model , indicating the acceptable performance of the east asian monsoon simulation .
except for the slight underestimation of the enso period and overestimation of the average amplitude , other characteristics of interannual variability over the tropical pacific are well reproduced in the cas-esm-c . it is particularly important that , benefiting from the realistic simulation of the seasonal cycle of sst over the tropical pacific , a &quot; phase-locked &quot; phenomenon appears in the simulated enso , which is hardly reproduced in other coupled models .
the main deficiency of the cas-esm-c is the tropic bias , which is common in other coupled models .
some analyses are made to reveal the possible reason behind these simulation biases especially the tropical bias . the results suggest that the biases in the atmosphere which are amplified by the ocean-atmosphere feedback are the key reasons of the tropic bias in the coupled system .
according to the analyses of the biases , future improvements of the cas-esm-c should focus on the treatment of physical processes of cloud and precipitation in the agcm . from this point , updating or improving the low-level cloud scheme and the convective parameterization of the atmosphere model may be the first step for the future development of the cas-esm-c

the model took advantages of gis technology of spatial analysis to get the preparatory areas , which guaranteed the quality of data source and increased the accuracy of the evaluation result .
finally , an application case verified the validity of the proposed model

secondly , the seismogenic structure is zhengfang ( f2 ) fault .
thirdly , nanping-ninghua fault zone should be valued as the main seismotectonics of fujian .
finally , the moderately strong earthquake may occur in shunchang-nanping area in the future
the behavior of calcite surfaces in the presence of cd2 + and pb2 + is investigated by in situ fluid cell atomic force microscopy ( afm ) to determine the differences between cd / calcite and pb / calcite interactions and the growth mode of surface precipitate .
experiments are conducted on { 10 ( -1 ) 4 } cleavage faces exposed to cd- and pb-bearing solutions that are undersaturated with respect to calcite , otavite , and cerussite .
two observations are made : ( 1 ) the presence of cd2 + does not affect the relative step kinetics along &lt; ( -4 ) 41 &gt; steps ( i .
vs + &gt; vs- ) during calcite dissolution , whereas pb2 + strongly retards the retreat of the obtuse &lt; 441 &gt; + steps to reverse the relative step kinetics ;
( 2 ) the initial dissolution is followed by a development of surface precipitation after the flow-through input is turned off to allow the surfaces to equilibrate with the solutions .
the surface precipitate grows in a layer spreading mechanism showing clearly defined directions in the presence of cd but not pb .
the kinetic effects of cadmium and lead on calcite dissolution are suggested to be related to a selective cation adsorption in accordance with the cation size , the geometry of adsorption complexes , and the crystallographic direction dependent step geometry .
the cd2 + ions , having a slightly smaller ionic radius than ca2 + , are thought to have a stronger presence along the acute &lt; ( -4 ) 41 &gt; _ steps that are geometrically more confined .
in contrast , the much larger pb2 + ions are believed to form distorted octahedral surface complexes to adsorb predominantly at the more open &lt; ( -4 ) 41 &gt; + steps .
the structural incompatibility between cerussite and calcite is speculated to account for the lack of step directions for the layer growth on calcite surfaces in the presence of pb2 + , the occurrence of layer-by-layer growth indicates that epitaxial growth plays an important role in the formation of ( ca , cd ) co3 and ( ca , pb ) co3 solid solutions

field measurement and remote sensing measurement are rudimental approaches to get vegetation coverage .
to analyze its characteristics and scope of application , we can reach the following conclusions : due to the restriction of many factors such as manpower and material resources , field measurement is unfit popularized as a single method in a wide measurement range , but it can offer remote sensing monitoring accuracy evaluation and validation essential data .
regression model method has relatively high precision in a small scale but with a strong dependence of the measured data .
vegetation index method and image element decomposition method are widely used at present for they are not subject to measured data . but in practice , we should accord to the surface condition to combine with other methods to increase the vegetation coverage extraction accuracy
by using outgoing longwave radiation ( olr ) data from national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) , daily wind ( 850 hpa ) data from european center for medium-range weath-er forecasting ( ecmwf ) and tropical cyclones ( tc ) data from joint typhoon warning center ( jt-wc ) , the impact of quasi-biweekly oscillation ( qbw ) on tropical cyclone activity over the western north pacific ( wnp ) is studied in this paper .
the index of 10 to 20-day oscillation is defined by refer-ring to the madden-julian oscillation ( mjo ) index proposed by wheeler and hendon ( 2004 ) .
the anal-ysis shows that tcs always occur in the area where convection is active .
the results show that tcs may present sudden poleward track change while its center overlaps with the center of the cyclone-circulations ( anticyclone-circulations ) of qbw
infrared ( ir ) observations from spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager ( seviri ) on board meteosat second generation ( msg ) -2 satellite are assimilated into ncep ( national centers for environmental prediction ) global data assimilation system ( gdas ) .
the assimilation of current geosta- tionary operational environmental satellite ( goes ) imager data was also reinvestigated .
the commu- nity radiative transfer model ( crtm ) was used as observation operator for the simulation of seviri radiance observations .
the crtm was enhanced with several critical components for ir radiance simu- lation , such as a dynamically-updated land surface emissivity data , as well as fast and accurate gaseous absorption modules .
the global space-based inter-calibration system ( gsics ) calibration corrections were applied to improve the simulation of seviri and goes imager radiances .
preliminary results show that inclusions of the seviri radiances at water co2channel ( 13.40 μm ) in global forecast system ( gfs ) vapor channels ( 6 . 25 and 7.35 μm ) and produced significant positive impacts on the six-day forecasts .
assimilation of other five seviri ir window channels in gfs reduces the positive impact .
by applying gsics calibration algorithm to correct seviri and goes-12 imager observations biases , the impacts on gfs forecast were improved .
further studies are being carried out to improve the effective assimilation of seviri ir window channels radiances
based on the lightning data by the world wide lightning location network ( wwlln ) and the typhoon data from typhoon institute of shanghai meteorological bureau , the paper presents the lightning activity characteristics and the relationship between the lightning frequency and the maximum winds of 55 typhoons occurring over the western pacific during 2005 and 2010 .
the results show that o-ver the west pacific , there are three distinct lightning flash regions in mature typhoons .
one significant maximum in the eyewall regions about 20-40 km away from the center ; the other two are located in outer rainbands ( 280-340 km and 440-580 km from the center ) .
most typhoons have lightning activ-ity peaks before the maximum winds . the lag times ranges from 0 to 24 hours and the average lag times is 26.6 h .
therefore , the frequency of lightning activity is , to some degree , an indicator for the typhoon intensity development within 24 h
sunspot area is an important feature to measure the solar activities .
prediction of sunspot area can provide useful information for solar activities and space weather studies , etc .

we also consider the influence of different training steps and prediction steps respectively .
the proposed method is able to exactly forecast the sun-spot area of the next month , and the relative errors for different training steps are all less than 5 % . however , the relative error will get larger if the prediction time is longer
a novel approach is proposed for cloud detection in satellite cloud image based on the im- proved graph cuts model .
10 gray features and 80 gabor texture features were selected from two chan-nels of fy-2c satellite image ( infrared channel 1 and visible light channel ) , and the dimensions of fea-ture vector were reduced to 9 by using pca ( principal component analysis ) .
then the similarity matrix was built up by those feature vectors . by using the spectral graph theoretic framework of normalized cuts , the cloud image was divided into 2 parts , the clear sky and the cloudy sky .
compared with the re-sult of surface observation , the average consistency was 86.51 % .
the results demonstrate that this method is effective in cloud detection
based on the radiation data from may of 2009 to april of 2010 at yangbajing in tibet , the daily , monthly and seasonal variations of total radiation , ultraviolet radiation , long-wave radiation and net radiation were discussed and the frequency and reasons why the radiation exceeds the solar constant were analyzed .
the results show that the total radiation , ultraviolet radiation , long-wave radiation and net radiation in yangbajing area present obvious daily , monthly and seasonal variation characteristics .
there is a positive correlation between the total radiation and ultraviolet radiation , between the total ra-diation and short-wave reflected radiation over earth surface and between the downward atmospheric ra-diation and long-wave reflected radiation over earth surface
based on the ncep / ncar , era-40 reanalysis datasets and 160 stations precipitation data in china in summer ( july and august ) , by means of correlation analysis , composite analysis and other methods , the interannual relationship between mascarene high ( mh ) and summer precipitation in north china and it &apos;s interdecadal variability are analyzed .
results show that there is significant negative corre-lation between the mh and sunkrner precipitation in north china in interannual time scale and that this negative correlation relationship began to diminish since 1974 .
during the stronger period ( 1951-1973 ) , significant negative correlation center between the mh and summer precipitation over eastern china was mainly located in north china , while during the weaker period ( 1974-2011 ) , the negative correlation between the mh and summer precipitation over north china became weaker , and significant positive correlation center was observed in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river .
the cause for interdecadal variability between mh and summer precipitation in north china is as follows : when eastern china is ( not ) influenced by the stronger anomalous south wind coming from mh , summer pre-cipitation in north china is more ( less ) , and the relationship between mh and summer precipitation in north china is in stronger ( weaker ) period .
the interdecadal variability of inter-annual relationship be-tween mh and summer precipitation in north china is one of the causes for the floods in southeast chi-na and droughts in northeast china since the mid-1970s
three-dimensional 4-day backward trajectories arriving in lanzhou at 500m high were calcu- lated every 6 h by using hysplit-4 trajectory model in spring of 2001 to 2008 . the 8 years were di-vided into two categories : high dust year ( 2001,2002,2004 and 2006 ) and low dust year ( 2003,2005 , 2007 and 2008 ) .
cluster analysis , potential source contribution function ( pscf ) model , and concentra- tion-weighted trajectory ( cwt ) method were used to evaluate the transportation pathways and poten-tial source regions of lanzhou pm10 pollution in spring .
results indicate that the western and northwest-ern pathways , respectively accounting for 33 % and 19.4 % of all trajectories , were major pathways leading to high springtime pm10 loadings in lanzhou in 2001,2002,2004 and 2006 .
however , the major pathways were the western and the northern pathways in 2003,2005,2007 and 2008 , accounting for 23.6 % and 18 % , respectively .
there were six potential source regions that had effect on pm10concen-tration in lanzhou , including tarim basin and turpan basin in xinjiang , qaidam basin in qinghai , hexi corridor in gansu province , the desert and gobi area in central and western inner mongolia
a process of severe convection occurring in shanghai on august 25,2010 is analyzed by u-sing laps ( local analysis and prediction system ) analysis field to assimilate various meteorological da-ta .
results showed that the storm was trigged directly by mesoscale convergence systems on middle and lower layers .
the convergence lines on surface developed into strong ones in the formation stage and became the major triggering mechanism of the mesoscale vertical circulation . in the meantime , the verti-cal structure contributed to the mesoscale convection development because of the convergence on mid-dle layer and the divergence on high layer . the prominent updraft zone located near the storm center , and the relative humidity grew significantly on middle and high layers .
in the mature stage , the down-draft drag , which occurred on low layer near the storm centre , made the updraft more slantwise .
the me-soscale circulation structure and moisture supply were destroyed in the decaying stage , and the vertical structure was contrary to that in the formation stage .
the laps analysis field has an advantage in spatial and temporal resolution , which well revealed the spatial structure and development process of meso and small scale systems in the mesoscale analysis
a thunderstorm ensemble forecasting approach is perti ~ rmed by the ensemble analysis of the cloud model &apos; s forecast results according to the initial condition aggregation provided by the grid fore-cast results of the mesoscale non-hydrostatic wrf model .
the approach is applied to forecast the char-acteristics of thunderstorm around nanjing one day in advance and is verified by the doppler radar data of the thunderstorms in summer in nanjing .
results show that the intensity and distribution of thunder-storms over the research area is reasonably predicted one day in advance . it is particularly good to fore-cast the distribution of the strong thunderstorms by using the ensemble forecasting technique .
moreover , the application of the pdf ( probability density function ) of thunderstorms &apos; duration into the probability forecasting of the influenced area of thunderstorms improves the radar &apos; s warning and monitoring capac-ity of local thunderstorms
based on slantwise vorticity development ( svd ) theory , the possible dynamical mechanism of a persistent torrential rain which occurred in mid-june of 2008 was analyzed , and the role of low lev-el jet ( llj ) in vorticity development was discussed .
meanwhile , several numerical simulations were performed to testify the rainstorm process based on mm5 and the results were further analyzed .
the re-sults indicate that : the development of low vortex from tibetan plateau was the primary cause for the precipitation in guangxi and guangdong at early stage . svd took effect while moist isentropic surface tended to slope and air particles had relative motions along isentropic surface . with certain condition ( cu 〈 0 ) , the vorticity got a further development afterwards .
moreover , the enhancement of llj changed the atmospheric baroclinity and caused the vorticity to develop and move eastward , which was the main cause for the persistent torrential rain in guangdong .
the results of simulation control test well revealed the development process of the vortex and precipitation .
the result of sensitive test showed that llj changed the stability of low level atmosphere and vertical shear of the wind , which meant that the baroclinity of the atmosphere was increasing . it thus made the mesoscale vortex develoo further
using tropopause pressure data and upper temperature data of 14 sounding stations over the tibetan plateau from 1979 to 2008 , the relationships between two types of tropopause heights and upper air temperature in different seasons are analyzed .
based on these , the coupling connection between as-cending motion ( total ozone ) and tropopause height is discussed by monthly ncep / ncar reanalysis data from noaa and monthly toms / sbuv total ozone data from nasa . the results indicate that the first ( second ) tropopause is at 300-200 hpa ( near 100 hpa ) over the year .
the seasonal , interannual variations and long-term trend of the two types of tropopause heights display closely opposite relation to those of temperature at their corresponding altitudes , respectively , namely the higher ( lower ) tropopause height , the lower ( higher ) temperature at the corresponding altitude .
the ascending motion is conducive to the rising of the tropopause height , especially the ascending motion at about 200 hpa ( 100 hpa ) is helpful to the rising of the first ( second ) tropopause height .
there is an obvious negative correlation be-tween the total ozone and the second tropopause height at each season . the second tropopause rises ( re-duces ) with the losing ( increasing ) of total ozone over the tibetan plateau . in recent years , the second tropopause height clearly lifts with the reducing of the total ozone
based on the observed daily temperature data from 62 stations in north china and ncep / ncar reanalysis data from 1961 to 2008 , the characteristics of negative accumulated temperature ( nat ) change in north china and its circulation background were studied through methods such as eof , reof , and wavelet analysis .
results show that : 1 ) the nat in north china increased consistent- ly , especially in northern shanxi province ;
2 ) the nat in north china can be divided into two subdi- visions because the nat increasing amplitudes were different in east and west .
there were both abrupt changes in the west and east of north china , occurring in 1988 and 1986 respectively . a 3-6 years &apos; cycle period was found in the west of north china while it was 2---4 years in the east of north china ;
3 ) changes of northern hemisphere winter atmospheric circulation had a close relation with the nat anomalies in north china .
further composite analysis showed that cold periods were represented by stronger siberian high , colder winter in north china and larger nat &apos; s absolute value near the ground while the main influence systems were the east asian trough and ural ridge in the middle troposphere . the stronger ural ridge and the deeper east asia trough made the cold air activity stronger in north china .
in warm periods , it was the opposite situation
two ensemble simulations for 22 boreal-summer seasons ( 1979-2000 ) are conducted by the community atmosphere model version 3 ( cam3 ) with the specified observed sea surface temperature ( sst ) .
impacts of surface soil moisture ( ssm ) on the simulation of potential predictability of east asi- an summer climate are investigated by the model with interannually varying ssm ( issm ) and climato- logical ssm ( cssm ) , respectively , based on the variance analysis method .
results show that , under the specified observed sst , the potential predictability of east asian summer climate simulated by the cam3 with issm is better than that with cssm over east asia , especially over northwest china .
the potential predictability of summer precipitation and air temperature over northwest china from issm simulations is 0 . 1 higher than that from cssm simulations .
a possible mechanism of influence of soil moisture on potential predictability of summer climate in northwest china is proposed .
the interannnal variability of ground evaporation and surface turbulent heat flux can be simulated by cam3 with issm better than with cssm in northwest china , leading to the model forecast skill of the summer climate improved by the model with issm

cyclostratigraphic analysis was undertaken with several different spectral analysis methods on the hanjiang formation of langhian age ( middle miocene ) in the pearl river mouth basin of south china sea , which consists of deltaic siliciclastic and neritic shelf carbonate rhythmic alternations .
within biochronological constraint , a high-resolution astronomical time scale was constructed through astronomical tuning of the natural gamma-ray well-logging record to the 65 ° n insolation curve and obliquity curve , which are from the most recent astronomically calculated variation of the earth  s orbit . the results show that the hanjiang formation cycles are controlled by variation of the earth  s orbital period .
the astronomically tuned time scale can be used to calculate astronomical ages for geological events and bioevents recognized throughout the period , and the results are only slightly different from earlier estimates in south china sea .
the astronomical time scale resolves the sedimentation history for the langhian stage ( middle miocene ) with a variation that strongly resembles that of the earth  s orbital eccentricity .
the main factor controlling the variability of the sedimentation rate in the hanjiang formation may be related to the 405 ka long period eccentricity

the land surface temperature in different landscape types was rather different .
the average land surface temperature of the hottest landscape types in 1988 and in 2007 were above 10 ℃ higher than the river , but the construction land was not the most important favors of the temperature changes in this research area .
the buffer zones of river corridor had lower temperature at shorter range , and with approaching to the road centerline the land surface temperature increased slightly .
research showed that compared with thermal environment effect of the urban landscape conclusion , agricultural landscape pattern had a unique and important influence on regional thermal environment

fine outcrop description as well as laboratory analysis were carried out to reveal the depositional model and the features of reservoir quality distribution of platform margin reef-shoal depositional system of the middle ordocician yijiangfang formation in bachu yijiangfang outcrop .
the results show that yijianfang formation is divided into five three-order sequences from bottom to top , each of which is comprised of tst and hst.formed by three genetic facies namely reef , bioclastic beach and background deposit of platform , the reef-shoal depositional system mainly develops at the carbonate platform margins of sequence 1 to sequence 3 .
the prograding reef-shoal depositional system is featured by the movement of high energy zone towards basin direction , and developed in the hst of sequence 1 and sequence 2 .
in the tst of sequence 3 , the retrograding reef-shoal depositional system is developed with the constant moving of high energy zone to the platform . in such a sequence , catch-up transgression reef-shoal complex develops in the early period , whereas keep-up transgression reef-shoal complex grows in the later one .
in the reef-shoal depositional system , the reef-front interior arenaceous beaches and reef-back interior arenaceous beaches are usually potentially high-quality reservoirs
mineral composition , micro-pore characteristics and well-logs from five wells were used to study the sealing capacity of the ordovician carbonate rocks in tazhong area , tarim basin .
the ordovician lianglitage and yingshan formations are at substage a-b of the middle diagenetic stage and substage a of the late diagenetic stage .
for the lianglitage formation grainstone , the breakthrough pressure ( bp ) is 1.81-29.76 mpa , and the threshold radius ( tr ) is 13.89-77.35 nm , .
for the marlstones , the bp is 14.33mpa and tr is 25.9-44.51 nm .
for the micritic limestone with band of argillite , the bp is 0.98-10.35 mpa and the tr is 13.52-142.60 nm .
the bp and the tr of the yingshan formation limy dolomites are 0.98-10.35 mpa and 13.52-142.60 nm .
thus , the marlstone and partial grainstone of the lianglitage formation and the yingshan formation dolomite limestone have certain sealing capacity , with thickness over 5 m , bp over 5 mpa , tr between 10-20 nm , pore throat radium less than 0.1 μm .
in addition , the tight interval consisted of dolomite limestone with high resistivity of 4-10 m thick in the yingshan formation is thought to be local caprocks in tazhong area .
its existence is one of the main factors resulting in the oil / gas distribution pattern in the ordovician yingshan formation in zhong-1 well , i. e. oil in its upper part and gas in its lower part
roughness , reflecting the smooth degree of the surface , is a key factor of many land surface processes .
there are various methods of parameterization , but questions still exist since the characterization of land surface system has far from been fully understood .
this paper reviews the research progress on land surface roughness characterization from three aspects , including land surface measurement techniques , roughness parameters , and remote sensing researches .
so far , pin profiler and laser profiler are still main-stream land surface measurement approaches , while 3d laser scan and photogrammetry techniques have shown their potentials .
parameters defined by statistical methods and fractal theories are quite distinct from each other , but it is hard to describe land surface using either category of parameters due to the the complexity of its multi-scaled feature .

in late january 2008 , there were rare durative snowstorm in jiangsu province . the study shows that the size of snowfall corresponds to the diurnal variation of low-level jet .
during the snow storm , the southwest jet at 700 hpa played an important role in the transport of water vapor .
as large-scale weather systems , the acceleration of the jet at 700 hpa occurs before snowfall &apos;s increase , its range did not correspond to the 6 hours accumulated snowfall , and it weakened after the end of snowstorm .
the occurrence and development of snowstorm have a relationship with the increase of north-south wind and the temperature advection , the low-level north wind as cold pad had played a certain role for the advection of warm and humid air and the condensation of water vapor .
the water vapor mainly comes from 700 hpa to 500 hpa , the low-level easterly flow had a limited role for the transportation of water vapor on the southern yellow sea .
the occurrence of snowstorm corresponds to the divergence of water vapor flux at 700 hpa . snowfall increased with the increase of moisture flux divergence .
during the snowstorm , vertical movement has good indication to the snowfall

during the summer half year , the space variation tendency of heavy rainfall days is uneven . it mainly increases ( decreases ) in the northeast ( southeast ) of qinghai and in the west ( east ) of tibet .
reservoirs in the northern north sea basin range from fractured basement to eocene deposits .
there are five sets of main reservoirs : ① the permian rottiegeudes aeolian and / or alluvial sandstones ;
② the triassic fluvial sandstone ;
③ the middle and lower jurassic fluvial , deltaic and marginal marine sandstone ;
④ the upper jurassic shallow marine and deep marine turbidite sandstone and conglomerate ;
⑤ the upper cretaceous-lower paleocene chalk and paleocene deep-sea turbidite fan sandstones .
it is found that the paleocene-eocene sandstone is weak in diagenesis and permeability becomes lower under 3100 m . the dissolution of k-feldspar is a major factor influencing diagenesis and permeability in the shallower part . then illite becomes the main factor below about 3700 m , and secondary quartz plays a major role in the sequence below 4000 m .
oil and gas accumulation depends on the distribution pattern of reservoirs

large permian and triassic carbonate gas reservoirs in the sichuan basin can be classified into 3 types , namely reef-bank gas reservoirs on platform margin , grain bank and dolomite reservoirs within platform , and weathering crust compound trap reservoirs .
the analysis of their gas accumulation patterns is significant for identifying future exploration targets .
the reef-bank gas reservoirs on the platform margin are obviously controlled by sedimentary facies . the process of hydrocarbon generation and accumulation is controlled by the paleohighs and current structures . this type of reservoirs is featured by early hydrocarbon migration and accumulation and late adjustment .
the grain bank and dolomite reservoirs within the platform are mostly formed at the late stage .
the superimposition of multiple thin reservoirs and effective fault carrier systems are critical to the formation of large scale gas reservoirs .
the weathering crust compound trap reservoirs are featured by superimposition of grain stones and hypergenetic karstification , which are critical to the formation of weathering crust reservoirs .
the weathering crust improved the conditions of source rocks , reservoirs , traps and seal combinations , so the contact between faults and formations resulted in many modes of hydrocarbon charging from fault plane , flank , and top side . this type of gas reservoirs was formed in the early stage and modified in the late stage

this paper presents a fast forward calculation method of gravity and magnetic anomalies for 3d arbitrary bodies based on gpu.the surface is subdivided into a large number of regular voxels .
for any 3d arbitrary body , the total volume can be combined by these voxels with fixed size and unknown physical properties ( density or susceptibility ) .
the gravity ( magnetic ) anomaly of these voxels at the surface points can be computed by the analytical method .
the sum of the above gravity ( magnetic ) anomaly of each voxel can represent the anomaly of the whole arbitrary body .
for the purpose of improving the approximation , the subsurface should be divided into a larger number of voxels .
the authors have adopted gpu parallel method for forward calculation because the traditional cpu program is time-consuming .
the result shows that the forward calculation by gpu has correct results and improved efficiency . the idea can provide the basis for 3d inversion of gravity and magnetic anomaly

a group of improving methods for the on-ground calibration of solar backscattered ultraviolet spectroradiometer ( sbus ) has been put forward to increase its precision of on-board detection and data inversion .
the full-waveband radiometric calibration in vacuum , which can attain correspondence match of condition between on-ground calibration and on-board detection , is the first item .
a spectral irradiance responsibility comparing measurement setup is built and the spectral irradiance response of sbus to a same source is measured in air and vacuum , respectively .
the result shows a 0.8 % relative deviation between air and vacuum in 250 ~ 300 nm and a wavelength dependent deviation , among which the maximum is a little more than 15 % , in 300 ~ 400 nm .
the individual uncertainty caused by calibration condition of sbus in vacuum is 1.8 % smaller than that in air .
after theoretical analysis and confirmatory testing , it is found that the spectral reflectivity of al + mgf2 coating of sbus reflecting element would be different in air and in vacuum , which proves the necessity of sbus calibration in vacuum condition
selenium speciation in root soil samples collected from the poyang lake basin of jiangxi province was investigated in this paper .
the results show a significant positive correlation between the species and total amounts of selenium in root soil . the residue species of selenium occupies 12.32 % of total selenium , and the species of bound-state humic acid approximately accounts for 66.23 % of the total amount of selenium in root soil .
meanwhile , selenium abundance in root soil insignificantly varies with the change of ph value but is significantly influenced by organic content .

zircon u-pb la-icp-ms dating for the three granite bodies yielded weighted mean ages of ( 109.6 ± 1.4 ) ma ( mswd = 3.7 ) , ( 112.2 ± 0.9 ) ma ( mswd = 0.06 ) and ( 113.7 ± 0.5 ) ma ( mswd = 0.21 ) , respectively , and indicates that they formed in the late stage of the early cretaceous .
from their zircon u-pb ages and post-collisional a2-type signatures , the authors infer that the bangonghu-nujiang middle tethys ocean should be closed at least in the beginning of the early cretaceous
currently , for the massive multi-source heterogeneous space-time data organization , management , integration difficulties , traditional methods in the data conversion process and other issues caused the data loss , combined with the characteristics of space-time data , this paper presented a new seamless integration of massive multi-source heterogeneous space-time data technology ( simmhs ) .

chemical analysis method , refection polarizing microscope ( pmr-pol ) , x-ray diffraction ( xrd ) , analysis type scanning electron microscope ( sem ) , and electron microprobe analysis ( empa ) to study the technological mineralogy and sorting properties of gold ore in jiaodong altered rock-type has been comprehensively applied .
the results show that the technological type of this ore belongs to low sulfide and gold-bearing pyrite .
66.7 % of the gold occurred in the natural form , with electrum making up the remaining 33.33 % .
the average purity of gold in this ore was 720.44 , natural gold was 829.72 , and electrum was 784.77 .
pyrite was the major carrier of gold .
the gold was primarily of fine or ulter-fine particles in the range of 5-37μm . the accumulation volume in this range of sizes was 99.83 % . gold in this ore is easy to liberate .
under the condition of about 55 % -65 % with coarse grinding less than 75μm , the disaggregation rate of gold in natural form and sulfide inclusion forms can reach about 94 % and obtain a good flotation index in the process of flotation
the lipids biomarkers were used wildly to reconstruct the pale-environment , but their form distributions varied distinctly in different sediments , so in this study , free and oh-labile lipids of surfacial sediments in southern coastal area of shandong peninsula were investigated .
the results showed that the fatty acids were obvious in even carbon number predominance , with c16 fatty acids as the main peak and characteristic of single peak distribution , hydrocarbons were also characteristic of single peak and c29 was the main hydrocarbon .
the fatty acids and sterols were mainly from autochthonous input , but the terrestrial input was the main source of hydrocarbons in the sediments .
the fatty acids existed as bound forms in majority , the differences in structure and source could be the primary factors that influenced the form distributions of fatty acids , sterols and hydrocarbons mainly existed in free forms , and ucm peaks only emerged in chromatograms of free hydrocarbons fractions
through the analysis of hydrocarbon migration pathway system of f , y oil layers and putaohua layer in shangjia oilfield , it is found that there are two types of migration pathway systems , simple fault type and fault-sandbody compound type .
by studying on effectiveness of migration pathway systems in shangjia oilfield , it is shown that the special morphology of structure controls the hydrocarbon migration direction of migration pathway systems , positive structure hinge line is the main passageway for hydrocarbon migrating laterally from qingshankou formation in sanzhao depression to shangjia area and accumulation places .
meanwhile , it is the rational matching of hydrocarbon migration pathway system with the various control factors of hydrocarbon accumulation in time and space that determines the hydrocarbon accumulation and reservoir formation of shangjia oilfield .
the transporting capacity variation of the simple fault migration pathway systems is of periodic episodic characteristics , while the transporting capacity of the fault-sandbody compound migration pathway systems is controlled mainly by the connection modes of faults with sandbodies and the transporting capacity of the sandbodies themselves .
the hydrocarbon migration pathway systems with the continuous joint mode and malposed joint mode between direction fault or antithetic fault and sandbody have lateral transporting capacity , while the hydrocarbon migration pathway systems with the discrete joint mode between antithetic fault and sandbody have no lateral transporting capacity .
the calculation of effective pathway space factor and the statistics of oil show layers in each reservoir group show that fu-1 reservoir sandbody of fuyu oil reservoir and yang-1 reservoir sandbody of yangdachengzi oil reservoir all have good lateral hydrocarbon transporting capacity
block j16 is an arch structure retained by two northern and southern downthrow faults . the reservoirs have fine sandstones and pebbled inequigranular sandstones mainly with high porosity and high permeability .
