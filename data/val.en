based on the survey data of collapse in wenchuan earthquake , this paper conducted statistical analysis to the relationship between the earthquake-induced collapse and rock mass structure , seismic intensity and slope geomorphy , and seeking to adopt comprehensive index method to predict seismic collapse .
the study shows that three structures of rock-soils , i. e . , strong weathered rock structure , rock mass with structure plane lean outwards , and rock mass with through steep structural plane , are easily collapse under seismic condition .
the density and scale of the collapse are enlarged with the increase of seismic intensity , and their relationship is exponential between .
slope height and geometric patterns also have important influence on the earthquake induced collapse .
we presented a systematic investigation of boron-doped 58s bioactive glass ( 58s-b ) to reinforce the porous 45s5 bioglass derived glass-ceramics .
the 45s5 / 58s-b composite powders were prepared by in situ mixing technique during synthesizing 58s-b via a sol-gel process .
the 45s5 / 58s-b composite glass ceramics with low and high porosity showed excellent low temperature ( 850 ℃ ) sintering behavior and improved compressive strength ( 40.2mpa ; 8.3mpa ) in comparison with the pure 45s5-derived glass-ceramics ( 14.9mpa ; 2.8mpa ) .
meanwhile , low-temperature ( 850 - 900 ℃ ) sintered composite porous glass-ceramics exhibited good biodegradability in tris buffer and a remarkable amount of bone-like hydroxyapatite was deposited on the surface of the porous materials .
this study is an important step to fabricate 45s5 bioglass derived glass ceramics with synergistic bioactivity , biodegradability and mechanical properties .
it is expected that such highly bioaetive and biodegradable porous glass-ceramics can be used for a variety of bone reconstructive surgeries , cell scaffolds , and regenerative medicine

bikou terrane is bounded by qinling orogenic belt to the north , songpan-ganzi oro- genic belt to the west , and yangtze block to the southeast . accompanying with indon-china oro- genic events in chinese continent , a lot of granitic dikes intruded in bikou terrane and its north margin .
there are mainly granitic dikes in the north margin , divided into several concentrated are- as from east to west , such as yuezhao-pibasi in kangxian , lianhecun-yangshan in wenxian .
in these areas , large to super large gold deposits were discovered one after another , for examples tangba , shuidonggou , yangshan , lianhecun , and jiawuchi gold deposits .
in this paper , new data are presented on geochemical compositions of the granitic dikes in pi- bashi , yangshan and jiawuchi in order to discuss petrogenesis , sourees of magma and tectonic set- ting of diagenesis of these dikes .
study shows that the sio2 and al2o3 of the granites range from 67.65 % to 74.86 % and 13.68 % to 19.61 % respectively , and the a / cnk varies from 1.11 to 5.4 .
rare earth elements ( ree ) content of the granites is low ( 24.22 * 10 6 -97.26 * 10-6 ) , with lan / ybn ratios of 3.29 = 22.40 . light rare earth elements ( lree ) are concentrated evident- ly and heavy rare earth elements ( hree ) are slightly negative eu anomalies ( δeu = 0.70-0.79 deficient .
the ree patterns are characterized by 79 ) . granites are also enriched in large ion litho- phile elements ( iales ) and relatively depleted in high field strength elements ( hfses ) .
it is showed that the granitic dikes were likely originated from subducted continental basement with greywackes as major composition .
on the basis of analytical data of geochronology of granites and gold deposits in this area , it is proposed that the granites in north margin of bikou terrane belong to post-eollisional setting with a peak activity of late triassic and closely related to delamination of thickening crust and underplating of mantle-derived material during collisional and orogenic processes .
these dikes were derived from partial melting of greywackes in middle-upper crust as a result of decompression and increasing temperature of thickening crust and upwelling of mantle- derived heat flow .
simultaneously , large-scale gold mineralization occurred in north margin of bikou terrane at early jurassic ( 190 ma-195 ma ) , 20 ma younger than the peak age of magma activity . ore-forming fluids and magmatie rocks may ascend along a common path , so the concen- trated districts of granitic dikes are favorable for gathering the ore-forming fluids , and conse- quently forming super large gold deposit
the maximum runout amount is an important factor in debris flow protection engineering design and hazard assessment .
in the wenchuan earthquake affected region , available methods are not doing well in the calculation of the potential runout amount of debris flow , because the sediment volume of debris flow basin has changed greatly , and the runout amount-frequency relationship differs greatly from the past .
regress analysis on the disaster area reveals that most of the debris flows in clustering debris flow events are of soil-mechanical type , and there exist a strong power-function correlation between sediment volume and maximum runout amount for the triggering rainstorm of 20-year return period .
volume and properties of sediment have a decisive influence on maximum debris flow magnitude . different amount of debris flows for different debris flow wate the hydrological forces from the rainfall processes .
the micro-topography change resulted in a hi and runout amount than predicted . the larger the frequency of triggering rainfall and the more rshed is decided by gher peak discharge sediment volume in a debris flow watershed , the more the rectangle watersheds and corresponding fan-shaped watersheds .
runout amount .
there is an obvious linear relationship between areas of maximum runout amounts , while the linear relationship is undetectable fo

the maoliling pluton , lithologically consisting mainly of quartz monzodiorite , quartz monzonite and fine-grained granite , is outcropped around xianrenqiao and maoliling of linhai county , zhejiang province .
la-icp-ms zircon u-pb ages show that the quartz monzodiorites and fine-grained granites were emplaced at 105.61.0ma and 104.80.9ma , respectively .
geochemically , the quartz monzodiorites show metaluminous , calc-alkaline and potassium-rich signatures , and have relatively high concentrations of mgo , fe2o3t and cao with high mg # values ( 47.6 ~ 50.6 ) , whereas the fine-grained granites show similar signatures in metaluminous and potassium-rich , but have lower contents of mgo , fe2o3t and cao with lower mg # values ( 41.6 ~ 47.0 ) than the quartz monzodiorites .
the quartz monzodiorites are enriched in rb , th , u , pb , and depleted in nb , ta , p , ti , and have relatively high contents in zr , hf and sr , with unconspicuous negative eu anomalies ( eu / eu * = 0.77 ~ 0.95 ) .
the fine-grained granites show similar trace and rare earth elements characteristics to those of quartz monzodiorites , but are more depleted in p , ti and sr , and display some degrees of negative eu anomalies ( eu / eu * = 0.55 ~ 0.78 ) .
the quartz monzodiorites and fine-grained granites show similar sr and nd isotopic compositions , with isr values of 0.7088 and 0.7079 ~ 0.7088 , and εnd ( t ) values of -7.57 ~ -7.56 and -8.06 ~ -7.95 , respectively .
meanwhile , they also have similar zircon hf isotopic compositions , with εhf ( t ) values of -12.2 ~ -6.6 and -9.6 ~ -4.4 , respectively .
the integrated petrology , elemental and isotopic compositions suggest that the quartz monzodiorites and fine-grained granites from maoliling pluton were most likely generated under a post-collisional extensional setting , and via a process including formation of parental magma by mixing of a underplated or an intraplated mantle-derived magma and an induced crustal-melted magma in the deep crust , then suffered differentiation during magma ascent to varying degrees and at last emplaced at a hypabyssal environment
an airport is planned to build in ankang city where expansive soil distributes widely . in order to provide the necessary basic parameters for the project , a field physical test model of the stability of fill slope was built at the proposed site .
a tracking test series of deformation of expansive soil fill slope under precipitation-evaporation cycle were conducted , and the the deformation evolution law and cause mechanism were analyzed .
the results show that : ( 1 ) stormwater infiltration process of the new fill slope can be divided into three stages : free infiltration , scouring infiltration and stable infiltration .
in this test , most time of the rain infiltration process is scouring infiltration stage , resulting in limited a infiltration depth .
( 2 ) for a complete uniform fill slope , the soil swelling deformation plays the leading role in the deformation development ;
at slope top the performance is vertical expansion and contraction deformation while at slope surface the performance mainly displays horizontal cumulative deformation .
with the increase of the depth and rainfall frequency , the slope deformation rate decreases dramatically .
( 3 ) the deformation of slope is closely related to the action of rainfall and evaporation , in which rainfall is the main factor in slope abrupt change , evaporation is a necessary prerequisite for the development of deformation .
( 4 ) two approaches should be adopted in preventing deformation and failure of the slope in rainfall-evaporation : one is to effectively weaken the variations of the moisture of the soil mass in influenced range of its surface layer , the other is to prevent runoff scouring action on the slopes
current reclamation of construction waste both home and abroad is introduced .

by applying lca it is possible to optimize environmental impacts from the source to the final disposal of waste building materials , and the lca methodology in road construction would effectively lower the economic and environmental burdens .
concerning the current situations in construction waste reclamation , source minimization , industrial development and life cycle management should be urgently employed
a numerical model based on three-dimensional incompressible navier-stokes equations and turbulence k-e model for the simulation of turbidity currents is applied to study the flow and deposition of turbidity currents with con stant inflows into different slope changes .
simulated results show some important characteristics about the flow of tur bidity currents : the depth-averaged velocity of turbidity currents with constant inflows increases with bed slope ; the higher the slope , the faster the thickness of currents increases in the downslope direction ;
on the nearly horizontal bed , velocity drops obviously while that from higher slope still keeps a relative higher velocity ;
also thickness of the currents increases almost at the same rate in the down stream direction , reflecting a slope-control on the water-entrain ment of turbidity currents . as to deposition characteristics , the simulation shows that a critical slope exists for a given sediment : when the slope is lower , there are more deposition on slope than that on horizontal bed , the whole slope in creases ;
while the slope is higher , there are erosion or less deposition on the slope with more deposition on down stream horizontal bed , thus resulting in a decrease in total slope .
understanding those flow and deposition characteris tics of turbidity currents may assist us in well interpreting the in-situ profiles from outcrop or seismic survey and recon structing the environment in which hydrocarbon reservoirs from
according to the conditions of hydraulic engineering in tibet , the climatic characteristics of tibet and its influence on performances of concrete are analyzed herein .
comparing with other regions in china , tibet has higher annual average solar radiation energy , greater daily temperature difference , more dryness , less rainfall and more gales .
the durability design of concrete should be conducted based on the environment , but the complete research data on concrete durability in high and cold regions cannot be obtained at present , so these should be studied immediately
the lower permian carbonate deposits of the chihsia formation located in chaohu , lower yan- gtze are studied in this paper , with emphasis on the relationship between paleoproduetivity , redox condi- tions and the formation of source rock , upon the basis of element geochemistry .
the results demonstrate that ba and tn have evident relations with biological deposition and can be used as a geochemical proxy for paleoproductivity . v / ( v2c-ni ) ratio , as a geochemical proxy to reconstruct the paleoredox , indicates that the chihsia formation was formed in an oxygen-deficient environment .
the above mentioned proxies sug- gest that paleoproductivity and paleoredox have close relation with sea level fluctuation .
the effective matching of algae productivity and preservation condition made the region favorable for source rock forma- tion while the chihsia formation was deposited .
high quality source rocks mainly occur in the lower part of the middle limestone member of the formation
no &quot; stationarity &quot; exists in the environmental background for the formation of many river flood series in the world any longer , and the traditional extreme value flow analysis , i. e . &quot; extreme value theory &quot; must be amended in order to adapt to these phenomena .
the annual maximum peak flow of longchuan and heyuan stations in dongjiang river basin exhibited a decreasing trend at the significance level of 0.01 detected by mann-kendall test after hydraulic engineering regulation .
in this study , the non-stationary processing method of time-varying moments ( tvm ) was adopted to analyze and calculate the annual maximum daily flow series at longchuan and heyuan stations of the dongjiang river basin .
five types of distribution curves and eight kinds of trend models , for a total of 40 models , were selected for comparison .
the results showed that lognormal distribution ( ln2 ) with a cp model ( cp refers to both the mean value and standard deviation have a parabolic type trend and the ratio of the two is constant ) at longchuan station , gumbel distribution with a cp model at heyuan station may obtain the optimal fitting effect .
after significant changes occur to the hydrological regime , the concept of tradition flood should be amended .
based on traditional frequency analysis methods , the design value of 100-year flood was available , indicating that a return period changed from less than 100 years before hydraulic engineering construction to 400 years after 2000 at two hydrological stations , rather than 100 years , for both stations .
in the context of non-stationarity , the flood design value corresponding the present time points should be recommended
